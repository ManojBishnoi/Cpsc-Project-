As one Metro Vancouver transit union gets set to escalate its strike action, another is taking a strike vote, adding to the potential for chaos for ######cal commuters.

CUPE 7000 represents about 900 SkyTrain workers and announced Tuesday a strike vote is underway for its members.

A statement from CUPE said the B.C. Rapid Transit Company, which operates SkyTrain on behalf of TransLink, turned down its la###### proposal for new bargaining dates, setting off the strike vote.

*Ministry of health’s emergency notification to the public that the Coronavirus influenza outbreak this time is very very serious & fatal. There's no cure once you are infected.*
*Its spreading from China to various countries*

*Prevention method is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins.*
*Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age.* *Everytime u feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand.* *Do not drink plenty at one time as it doesn’t help, instead continue to keep throat moist.*
*Till end of March 2020, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation* *Avoid fried or spicy food and ######ad up vitamin C.*
*The symptoms/ description are*
*1.repeated high fever*
*2.pro######nged coughing after fever*
*3.Children are prone*
*4.Adults usually feel uneasy,*headache and mainly respiratory related*
*5: highly contagious*🚨

05/02/2020, 11:02 pm - dharun cls: there are 2 ways:
05/02/2020, 11:02 pm - dharun cls: if you are using matp######tlib then  use the line "%matp######tlib notebook"
05/02/2020, 11:03 pm - dharun cls: and then write the code for your p######t then you will get it.

05/02/2020, 11:26 pm - dharun cls: Yeah, this method is pretty straight forward. Only drawback is that you can have both the static and interactive p######ts at a time. It's either this or that.

11/02/2020, 5:57 pm - Amir ######: 😄
11/02/2020, 9:26 pm - dharun cls: Yeah...so I figured out how to do this. Incase anyone is still wondering. By using "GLM" you only get R² and getting Adj-R² from R² using formula is too mainstream. 
But if you create a new column 'cost2 = cost*cost' and then run "proc reg", you will get adj-R².
11/02/2020, 9:27 pm - Roberta ######: you have to use glm Dharum
11/02/2020, 9:27 pm - Roberta ######: actually for the first one does not make difference
11/02/2020, 9:27 pm - Roberta ######: but the last one that you have several predictors make
11/02/2020, 9:28 pm - dharun cls: Yeah for the other things yes..
11/02/2020, 9:28 pm - dharun cls: But if you only need Adj-R² then go with this approach.
11/02/2020, 9:28 pm - Roberta ######: If you want to use glm procedure and get the adjusted r quared
11/02/2020, 9:28 pm - Roberta ######: this is the syntax
11/02/2020, 9:29 pm - Roberta ######: proc glmselect data=naval p######t=CriterionPanel;
model percent = cost cost2
/ selection=forward(select=SL) stats=all;
run;
11/02/2020, 9:29 pm - Vedant ######: I’m just using Linear Regression function from the ###### panel. Any ideas on that? 😅
11/02/2020, 9:34 pm - Beth ######: proc reg data = NAVALBASE_new;
     model percent = cost cost2; inter cost2;
     F_partial: ###### cost2;

11/02/2020, 9:35 pm - Beth ######: i got adj r2 for this code.. not sure if i am right
11/02/2020, 9:36 pm - Vedant ######: If you use RStudio, you’ll get adj-R square
11/02/2020, 9:36 pm - Beth ######: I use SAS

I think people might be a bit over panicking but I unders######d if some want to be over prepared if we go on a city wide ######ckdown. Who knows if that would happen though.

16/03/2020, 10:42 pm - Vedant ######: Are you sure? Concatenating the chunks and then getting value counts for string columns works perfectly, but I'm not sure what he wants man
16/03/2020, 10:42 pm - dharun cls: breaking the data into chunks to read in the data is a good method to import data. But using the dataset as chunks is bound to give faulty ######s.
16/03/2020, 10:42 pm - dharun cls: That is what he is trying to teach us, indirectly.
16/03/2020, 10:43 pm - dharun cls: In both the cases, increasing the chunk size or  merging them all together can improve the accuracy of the results.

Because it says-
'Display the number of columns for each unique data type found.'
Irrespective of the fact, you are dealing with full dataframe or chunk. 
Both should have same number of columns for each unique data type.

working parents who must stay home without pay to care for children that are sick or need additional care because of school and daycare c######sures.
workers who still have their emp######yment but are not being paid because there is currently not sufficient work and their emp######yer has asked them not to come to work.
wage earners and self-emp######yed individuals, including contract workers, who would not otherwise be eligible for Emp######yment Insurance.

On the government website, eligible claimants are those who have immigrant’s status and have work permit. Does it include student visa as well?
27/03/2020, 10:30 pm - Amir ######: A: CERB applies to any resident of ###### who is 15 years old and has earned at least $5000 from: emp######yment, self-emp######yment, EI maternity ######efits or EI parental ######efits. You should apply.
27/03/2020, 10:31 pm - Amir ######: this is from a lawyer mentioning international students directly

27/03/2020, 10:32 pm - Beth ######: I don't qualify...
27/03/2020, 11:10 pm - minoj bishnoi ######: Who qualifies?

The CERB covers *Canadians* who have ######st their job, are sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19, as well as working parents who must stay home without pay to care for children because of school or daycare c######sures.

It also applies to anyone who was laid off and qualifies for EI. But unlike EI, it also applies to people who don’t, such as freelancers, contractors and people still technically emp######yed but no ######nger receiving income due to the pandemic.

To qualify, applicants must have had $5,000 in emp######yment income, self-emp######yment income, or maternity or parental leave ######efits for 2019 or in the 12-month period preceding the day they make the application.

So basically, it’s designed to fill any gaps left by existing income support programs when it comes to people who’ve ######st work because of COVID-19.
27/03/2020, 11:10 pm - minoj bishnoi ######: It says Canadian 😐

31/03/2020, 4:56 pm - kirra: Yeah but that is for df 24

31/03/2020, 4:57 pm - Edward: she said that F 0.025,25,28 is similar to F 0.025,24,28
31/03/2020, 4:58 pm - Edward: approximate
31/03/2020, 4:58 pm - kirra: Yeah i guess but in ###### she said to give the range so i ######umed it was between df 24 and 30
31/03/2020, 4:59 pm - Edward: i think it is fine to use range or approximation in this ######
31/03/2020, 5:02 pm - Edward: Hi All,

I kept waiting for you guys on ###### to show up for today's ######.

However, it ######oks like you guys were expecting that the ###### would take place on Wednesday just like last week.

If that's the case, let's do the lecture tomorrow at 4:30 PM. We will have one more lab after this and then we would be done with the course outline.

See you guys tomorrow. The ###### meeting ID is the same as before, i.e. 988-105-6838.

Best wishes.

02/04/2020, 7:35 pm - vasu: Not a bad deal
02/04/2020, 7:40 pm - arsh ######: As we all know, it is a hard time for everyone especially the international students who have become hand to mouth in lieu of COVID19.

We have limited amount of funds with hardly any savings available and seeing unpromising current situation and the time to come, It would be really hard for us to pay the entire fee this ######. 

Moreover as ###### has made it’s decision to go online for the summer ######, it is my humble request on behalf of our batch PDD Data Analytics (Fall 2019) that a considerable fee waiver is offered for this ######. 

It will be fair as students would no ######nger be using the infra services during this ###### and they will just be accessing study material online.

Kindly do the needful! It would mean a ######t.

it should be as a result of 
instead
02/04/2020, 7:50 pm - Amir ######: Greedy bastards as they are, they will most probably decline any fee wavering. So we could add at the end of the letter something like this: If the aforementioned request is not possible, please at least consider putting off the registration fee for later when everything's back in order.

I’ve only replied to a handful of students in your cohort, hoping that they will share this info to everybody in your cohort. Could you help me do that?

- Please unders######d that I cannot do overrides for BUSM courses. The Business Department Chair has to do it.

- Both the Business Dept Chair and I are fully aware of this situation. He will give you a different type of override soon (I don’t know when). But when he does, you will get another email notification. Then you can try register for the course again.

- Meanwhile, there is no point to keep trying (as the status has been changed).

- Thanks for your patience.

21/04/2020, 7:51 pm - Vedant ######: He most likely won’t. I think that marks increase offer was only for those who got a lesser grade than C. But I hope I’m wrong.

02/05/2020, 10:33 am - Vedant ######: Hi guys! Hope you're all doing well and are safe during these times.

The preceding batch did us a favor by estalishing the Data Analytics Club and we thank them for it. Now that they've graduated, it's up to us to take it forward. Luckily, we have been able to maintain an active status for our club this semester and would be working on conducting online events - webinars, calls, peer tutoring and other knowledge sharing sessions, etc. We would also be working creating a club website and relevant content.

For this to happen, we need a core team to be put in place starting with a vote to choose the new Club President, who would undertake major responsibilities of decision making, setting up core team, club management, sponsor management, event management and further sharing responsibilities, etc. A unanimous vote seems to be the best way of doing so. Anyone who'd like to nominate themselves for the position can submit their names here on the group by 12pm today. Once I have all the nominations, I will create an online form for voting and forward it to everyone. Voting will commence at 3pm and end at 5pm. Please make sure that all votes are submitted within the stated time frame. We hope that everyone participates since it's for our own ######efit.

Thanks.

24/06/2020, 3:18 pm - vasu: Yes, his name is ABCD
24/06/2020, 3:34 pm - Amir ######: This is what I found out from internet: Bokeh widgets like sliders don't work in jupyter notebooks (at least, not without using some javascript).
24/06/2020, 3:35 pm - Amir ######: It seems we can't simply use the way he has mentioned in his pdf
24/06/2020, 3:36 pm - vasu: True/
24/06/2020, 3:36 pm - Amir ######: the function must be a javascript-ish style:
24/06/2020, 3:36 pm - Amir ######: slider######llback = CustomJS(
    args=dict(source_visible=source_visible,
              source_available=source_available), code="""
        var selected_function = cb_obj.value;
        // Get the data from the data sources
        var data_visible = source_visible.data;
        var data_available = source_available.data;
        // Change y-axis data according to the selected value
        data_visible.y = data_available[selected_function];
        // Update the p######t
        source_visible.change.emit();
    """)
24/06/2020, 3:37 pm - Amir ######: The method he describes in the PDF, far as I figured out, can only be run in a bokeh server command
24/06/2020, 3:38 pm - naval clss: Yup
24/06/2020, 3:38 pm - Amir ######: It maybe a good idea to ask him to demonstrate it himself
24/06/2020, 3:38 pm - naval clss: But cannot show output in notebook
24/06/2020, 3:38 pm - naval clss: it displays in html
24/06/2020, 3:39 pm - naval clss: also port number 5006 should be free
24/06/2020, 3:39 pm - naval clss: Because this file gets dep######yed only in that port
24/06/2020, 3:39 pm - Amir ######: 👍
24/06/2020, 3:39 pm - Amir ######: I hope Jas is satisfied now

29/06/2020, 10:07 am - Vedant ######: Whatever the case. 50% for just a wrong version of the file is unreal. She can die and I would really not give a QW about it. And honestly, she can’t expect students to notice what extension of the file she’s mentioned in the instructions when they are so busy working on a freakishly ######ng ###### that she QWing copied from a youtube video.
29/06/2020, 10:08 am - Roberta ######: And you have to do in 90m
29/06/2020, 10:09 am - kirra: She needed to write a disclaimer
29/06/2020, 10:09 am - Prerna ######: True. If 50% of the marks were at stake, she should've mentioned that in bold that you'd ######se 50% for not submitting in .doc extension.

29/06/2020, 10:09 am - kirra: Yes

29/06/2020, 10:10 am - Roberta ######: Not fair

29/06/2020, 10:14 am - naval clss: I'm getting screwed with all her bullshit schemes
29/06/2020, 10:14 am - naval clss: In ######, sum of id should be checked, not id
29/06/2020, 10:14 am - naval clss: Now word not pdf
29/06/2020, 10:15 am - naval clss: And when it comes to actual teaching
29/06/2020, 10:15 am - naval clss: she is just copying everything from youtube link

30/06/2020, 7:52 pm - Vedant ######: *Normalization* usually means changing your observations so that they can be described as a normal distribution or a bell-shaped distribution. *Scaling* refers to transforming a variable scale to have a values between 0 and 1. When you normalize during PCA, scaling will take place a######ngside and all the values will change to a scale of 0 to 1.

Meanwhile, *s######dardization* transforms data to have a mean of zero and a s######dard deviation of 1.

In R, *center=TRUE* will s######dardize your dataset and *scale.=TRUE* will normalize your dataset while executing PCA using prcomp().

Hope that helps.
