1142,2019-11-27,11:26, kirra, She is not gonna mark ur team mate down for that
1143,2019-11-27,11:26, Roberta Langara, But we don't have to do our own feedback
1144,2019-11-27,11:26, kirra, Yepp
1145,2019-11-27,11:26, kirra, But even if my team mate gives me 5 0s
1146,2019-11-27,11:26, Roberta Langara, you just have to feedback your team mates and she is going to evaluate based on the rubric
1147,2019-11-27,11:26, kirra, Shes not gonna minus points for
1149,2019-11-27,11:27, Roberta Langara, if you really aplied the rules of giving feedback

1167,2019-11-28,16:40, kirra, Which is useless cuz we have CPSC on friday anyway
1168,2019-11-28,16:44, vasu, After CPSC exam u don't have any work to do
1169,2019-11-28,16:44, vasu, So you can do it freely
1170,2019-11-28,16:45, kirra, Yepp
1171,2019-11-28,16:45, kirra, Hopefully she gives the extension
1172,2019-11-28,16:45, kirra, Cuz she said last time shes only gonna give until thursday at most

1414,2019-04-12,00:29, Beth Langara, the z score
1415,2019-04-12,00:29, kirra, Did she calculate that herself?
1416,2019-04-12,00:29, Beth Langara, yes
1417,2019-04-12,00:30, kirra, How?
1418,2019-04-12,00:30, kirra, Can u show?
1419,2019-04-12,00:31, jasman cls, <Media omitted>
1420,2019-04-12,00:31, kirra, I cant find that in formula sheet
1421,2019-04-12,00:31, kirra, Its kinda scary
1422,2019-04-12,00:32, kirra, So we have to memorize
1423,2019-04-12,00:32, jasman cls, We can calculate
1424,2019-04-12,00:32, kirra, Oh ok
1425,2019-04-12,00:32, jasman cls, <Media omitted>
1426,2019-04-12,00:33, jasman cls, You have to look z value at the probability 0.95
1427,2019-04-12,00:33, Beth Langara, prob is .90
1428,2019-04-12,00:33, Beth Langara, look for z score
1429,2019-04-12,00:34, Beth Langara, <Media omitted>
1430,2019-04-12,00:35, jasman cls, 0.95
1431,2019-04-12,00:36, Beth Langara, i mean u can use .95 using her way..
1432,2019-04-12,00:37, jasman cls, 0.95 would be between 0.9495 and 0.9505 which lies at  z 1.6 0.4 and 0.5
1433,2019-04-12,00:38, jasman cls, So its 1.645 I think so😂
1434,2019-04-12,00:38, Beth Langara, yes.. exactly
1435,2019-04-12,00:38, kirra, Thx

1440,2019-04-12,8:52, Roberta Langara, z critical for 95%
1441,2019-04-12,15:01, arsh langara, its for 90%
1443,2019-04-12,15:02, Roberta Langara, Yes you're write

3229,2020-08-02,1:18, Prerna Langara," ""rear""😅😅"

3242,2020-08-02,1:29, Kania Langara, I don't think a midterm should be informed on a short notice

3368,2020-10-02,19:20, jaspreet cls canada, This is the registration link: 
3371,2020-10-02,19:23, dharun cls," @12368883428 what did Khuram say about the ""pie"" question?"
3372,2020-10-02,19:23, Edward, Great question
3373,2020-10-02,19:23, Edward, I will clarify it tonight
3374,2020-10-02,19:23, dharun cls, Hahaha...
3375,2020-10-02,19:24, dharun cls, Oh great...
3376,2020-10-02,21:36, dharun cls, Does anyone know how to get the R²a for 4.88.. from the DANA assignment 2
3377,2020-10-02,22:53, kirra, R u talking about 4.88(f)?
3378,2020-10-02,22:57, Edward, R² ?!🤔
3379,2020-10-02,22:58, Kania Langara, Isnt that just adjusted r-square? Isn't that in the R output?
3380,2020-10-02,23:00, Amir Langara, I could not find it ir SAS regression output for that question either
3381,2020-10-02,23:00, Roberta Langara, there is no output in the book for that question
3382,2020-10-02,23:00, Roberta Langara, so I think we have to run the model
3383,2020-11-02,6:54, dharun cls, I'm using sas and I'm not able to find that in SAS
3384,2020-11-02,6:55, dharun cls, SAS output only gives R² and not adj-R²
3385,2020-11-02,8:10, Roberta Langara, Gives you adjusted R
3386,2020-11-02,8:53, vasu, Yes everytime you have this in output
3387,2020-11-02,9:02, Roberta Langara, On the glm procedure we don't have adjusted r square just the regular
3388,2020-11-02,9:02, Roberta Langara, And we should use glm
3389,2020-11-02,9:03, Roberta Langara, Because is a quadratic regression
3390,2020-11-02,9:03, Roberta Langara, But with the regular one you can get the adjusted
3391,2020-11-02,9:34, arsh langara, sometimes i feel 
3394,2020-11-02,9:35, Roberta Langara, Sometimes I feel that I'm in the wrong course
3395,2020-11-02,9:35, Roberta Langara, 😂
3396,2020-11-02,9:36, harshad cls, <Media omitted>
3397,2020-11-02,9:39, arsh langara, wht the heck is glm
3398,2020-11-02,9:39, arsh langara, 😶
3399,2020-11-02,9:39, tuli class, I think about this everyday
3400,2020-11-02,12:58, jaspreet cls canada, in this python assignment
3401,2020-11-02,12:58, jaspreet cls canada, <Media omitted>
3402,2020-11-02,12:59, jaspreet cls canada, we need to explicitly convert data to percentages or there is some function for that

3420,2020-11-02,15:32, kirra, I think we have more credits next semester
3421,2020-11-02,15:33, kirra, Not because of tuition increase
3422,2020-11-02,15:33, dharun cls, Oh then that's a different thing
3423,2020-11-02,15:34, vasu, 🤨

3435,2020-11-02,17:35, Amir Langara, how does he know my name?!
3436,2020-11-02,17:36, Amir Langara, or anybody’s?!
3437,2020-11-02,17:36, arsh langara, you mailed him for midterms
3438,2020-11-02,17:37, Amir Langara, I didn’t attach a picture of me to that email 😄
3439,2020-11-02,17:53, arsh langara, Then be happy
3441,2020-11-02,17:57, Amir Langara, 😄
3442,2020-11-02,21:26, dharun cls," Yeah...so I figured out how to do this. Incase anyone is still wondering. By using ""GLM"" you only get R² and getting Adj-R² from R² using formula is too mainstream. "
3444,2020-11-02,21:27, Roberta Langara, you have to use glm Dharum
3445,2020-11-02,21:27, Roberta Langara, actually for the first one does not make difference
3446,2020-11-02,21:27, Roberta Langara, but the last one that you have several predictors make
3447,2020-11-02,21:28, dharun cls, Yeah for the other things yes..
3448,2020-11-02,21:28, dharun cls, But if you only need Adj-R² then go with this approach.
3449,2020-11-02,21:28, Roberta Langara, If you want to use glm procedure and get the adjusted r quared
3450,2020-11-02,21:28, Roberta Langara, this is the syntax
3451,2020-11-02,21:29, Roberta Langara, proc glmselect data=naval plot=CriterionPanel;
3455,2020-11-02,21:29, Vedant Langara, I’m just using Linear Regression function from the task panel. Any ideas on that? 😅
3456,2020-11-02,21:34, Beth Langara, proc reg data = NAVALBASE_new;
3460,2020-11-02,21:35, Beth Langara, i got adj r2 for this code.. not sure if i am right
3461,2020-11-02,21:36, Beth Langara, I use SAS
3462,2020-11-02,21:37, Vedant Langara, No wonder companies are getting rid of SAS
3463,2020-11-02,21:42, Vedant Langara, <Media omitted>
3464,2020-11-02,21:46, dharun cls, I hope we *all* figure out a way to crack the midterm the same way we did this one.🤞🏼

3977,2020-02-23,21:52, arsh langara, 1st is by global f test
3979,2020-02-23,21:54, arsh langara, partial*
3980,2020-02-23,21:54, arsh langara, @16047219059 ?
3981,2020-02-23,21:57, Vedant Langara, Should be by individual t-test
3983,2020-02-23,21:58, Vedant Langara, Second by partial f-test
3984,2020-02-23,21:58, arsh langara, 🤯
3985,2020-02-23,21:59, Vedant Langara, That’s what I think :P
3987,2020-02-23,21:59, arsh langara, i read conducting individual t is not a good approach so use partial f 
3989,2020-02-23,21:59, arsh langara, 😕
3990,2020-02-23,22:00, tuli class, Nice

4014,2020-02-23,22:34, kirra, Why partial and not global?
4015,2020-02-23,22:35, kirra, They didnt specify
4016,2020-02-23,22:35, kirra, If they wanted to check all or some of the variables

4395,2020-02-26,21:44, jasman cls, He seems to be more tough than Estella 🤔
4396,2020-02-26,21:44, Roberta Langara, Estella is passive agressive
4397,2020-02-26,21:44, Roberta Langara, Emma is agressive agressive

4415,2020-02-26,21:47, aditi jaswal, Both the names start from 'E'. So both of them are equally bad.. end of discussion
4416,2020-02-26,21:47, Roberta Langara, Even her co worker said that she's mean
4417,2020-02-26,21:48, aditi jaswal, Saying someone who told me to change my idea..
4418,2020-02-26,21:48, Roberta Langara, I just want the funny instructor

5099,2020-03-13,14:44, kirra, I thought about doimg that for masks
5100,2020-03-13,14:44, kirra, Amazon sold out of those N95 masks
5101,2020-03-13,14:44, Kania Langara, Ppl! Have some humanity omg
5102,2020-03-13,14:45, Roberta Langara, They don't know shit about how the virus works
5103,2020-03-13,14:46, Roberta Langara, Mask doesn't prevent you to get
5104,2020-03-13,14:46, Kania Langara, Yeap
5105,2020-03-13,14:46, Kania Langara, But masks are important for those who are sick
5106,2020-03-13,14:46, Roberta Langara, Even I that just study like 6m of microbiology know this
5107,2020-03-13,14:46, Kania Langara, So they don't spread to more ppl
5108,2020-03-13,14:46, Roberta Langara, Yes is important for those who are sick
5109,2020-03-13,14:47, Roberta Langara, I'm more curious about Langara behaviour
5110,2020-03-13,14:47, dharun cls, YES!!!!!!
5111,2020-03-13,14:47, Roberta Langara, Ok to not cancel classes (although I don't think is the best call)
5112,2020-03-13,14:47, dharun cls, Friends from other college have their finals *online*
5113,2020-03-13,14:47, Roberta Langara, But don't cancel this career event
5114,2020-03-13,14:47, dharun cls, we are not even close to having our campus closed
5115,2020-03-13,14:47, Roberta Langara, Is nuts
5116,2020-03-13,14:48, Roberta Langara, They should go online with almost every course
5117,2020-03-13,14:48, Kania Langara, They just keep wanting to believe the risks is low.. as always
5118,2020-03-13,14:48, kirra, <Media omitted>
5119,2020-03-13,14:49, Roberta Langara, To contain the spread is all about prevention
5120,2020-03-13,14:49, kirra, These are the type of mask that you should be wearing
5121,2020-03-13,14:49, Roberta Langara, So they are waiting someone got sick to stop classes
5122,2020-03-13,14:49, Roberta Langara, But when someone discovers that ok I'm sick
5123,2020-03-13,14:50, Roberta Langara, They already spreaded virus through the entire campus
5124,2020-03-13,14:50, Roberta Langara, Also there are people who are very poor in hygiene
5125,2020-03-13,14:50, Kania Langara, I think just don't touch your face before washing your hands
5126,2020-03-13,14:50, Kania Langara, Totally!! Ppl on the buses and trains still cough yawns sneezes w/o covering their mouths
5127,2020-03-13,14:51, Kania Langara, Difficult to hammer these into their heads

5451,2020-03-16,21:01, Vedant Langara, Not supposed to be the same
5452,2020-03-16,21:01, cici, What about task6?
5453,2020-03-16,21:01, Vedant Langara, Working on it
5454,2020-03-16,21:03, cici, I got different result again in task 6🤦🏻‍♀️
5455,2020-03-16,21:03, cici, I know...
5456,2020-03-16,21:03, cici, Why we have to create list first🤦🏻‍♀️
5457,2020-03-16,21:03, Vedant Langara, I don’t get this guy. So weird.
5458,2020-03-16,21:04, cici, Maybe he just want to test you how to create list and then append it
5459,2020-03-16,21:07, Vedant Langara, Bring it on lol
5460,2020-03-16,21:20, kirra, Maybe its also spposed to be diffeent?
5461,2020-03-16,21:20, kirra, For task 6?
5462,2020-03-16,21:22, Vedant Langara, Don’t know yet
5463,2020-03-16,22:40, dharun cls, You have to get different results for Df and the chucks
5464,2020-03-16,22:40, dharun cls, For both task 5 & 6 it has to be different.
5465,2020-03-16,22:40, dharun cls, And his following questions does not ask if they are the same..
5466,2020-03-16,22:41, dharun cls, They ask if you agree with what you see and how to avoid the difference.
5467,2020-03-16,22:42, dharun cls, breaking the data into chunks to read in the data is a good method to import data. But using the dataset as chunks is bound to give faulty answers.
5468,2020-03-16,22:43, dharun cls, This is what I know. And I think this makes sense.

5493,2020-03-17,12:59, Vedant Langara, You create one presentation and record voiceovers for your part. Then merge all the voiceovers and align it with your presentation. Too much work.

5540,2020-03-17,17:01, dharun cls, Omg .. you guys are making me panic ..
5541,2020-03-17,17:01, Roberta Langara, Also small companies will suffer
5542,2020-03-17,17:01, Roberta Langara, Because they can't be open
5543,2020-03-17,17:01, dharun cls, We should all join toilet paper company's
5544,2020-03-17,17:01, Roberta Langara, I'm living this panic since Thursday
5545,2020-03-17,17:01, dharun cls, Companies*

5549,2020-03-17,17:02, kirra, Canada will decrease permanent residency visas in the next few years because of recession
5550,2020-03-17,17:02, Roberta Langara, I think they should at least pause for two weeks
5551,2020-03-17,17:02, Roberta Langara, Maybe other way
5552,2020-03-17,17:02, david langara, Oh my gosh. And we're just starting. Restaurants have had less than 50% in customers for 2 weeks in anrow and more business are closing causing no cashflow.
5553,2020-03-17,17:02, Roberta Langara, They increase
5554,2020-03-17,17:02, jasman cls, Yeahh
5555,2020-03-17,17:03, Roberta Langara, They rely on immigrants to pay taxes
5556,2020-03-17,17:03, Roberta Langara, The whole canadian pension system need of immigrants
5557,2020-03-17,17:03, jasman cls, Their economy has increased just because of immigrants/ international students
5558,2020-03-17,17:04, dharun cls, Wow... I feel dumb ..
5559,2020-03-17,17:04, Amir Langara, we should ask langara to put our tuition into instalments to be paid in the future
5560,2020-03-17,17:04, Roberta Langara, Also we have to account that these kind of diseases could create a panic fear worldwide
5561,2020-03-17,17:05, Roberta Langara, That will reduce immigration moviment
5562,2020-03-17,17:05, dharun cls, https://www.instagram.com/p/B91pGBRF-rB/?igshid=kn9zdgm5r1lm
5563,2020-03-17,17:05, Roberta Langara, Because we can see that anti globalization agenda is  based on closed markets and less immigration
5564,2020-03-17,17:06, kirra, Now is the best time to buy stocks though 🤣
5565,2020-03-17,17:06, Roberta Langara, Maybe the corona will give more strength to this political setup
5566,2020-03-17,17:06, Roberta Langara, Or on the other hand people can ask for more social protection and bigger welfare state
5567,2020-03-17,17:07, Roberta Langara, And the world move for social democracy
5568,2020-03-17,17:07, Roberta Langara, I think we will now after us election

5629,2020-03-18,14:14, jaspreet cls canada, in last question DANA assignment we need to remove two outlier or one
5630,2020-03-18,14:17, Kania Langara, i removed 2
5631,2020-03-18,14:17, jaspreet cls canada, ok
5632,2020-03-18,14:24, Roberta Langara, I removed one
5633,2020-03-18,14:30, jaspreet cls canada, so in both cases we are rejecting null hypothesis
5634,2020-03-18,14:30, jaspreet cls canada, means I am rejecting null in both
5635,2020-03-18,14:32, Roberta Langara, With outlier reject
5636,2020-03-18,14:32, Roberta Langara, Without outlier fail to reject
5637,2020-03-18,14:33, jaspreet cls canada, but if we remove both outlier
5638,2020-03-18,14:33, jaspreet cls canada, rejects null in both cases
5639,2020-03-18,14:33, Roberta Langara, Have to check but I don't think so
5640,2020-03-18,14:36, kirra, Only 31
5641,2020-03-18,14:36, kirra, Is outlier
5642,2020-03-18,14:36, kirra, @12363340235
5643,2020-03-18,14:36, kirra, I think lol
5644,2020-03-18,14:37, jaspreet cls canada, box plot there are two right
5645,2020-03-18,14:37, Roberta Langara, I just excluded 31
5646,2020-03-18,14:41, kirra, <Media omitted>
5647,2020-03-18,14:41, kirra, they didnt consider -13 to be a significant outlier
5648,2020-03-18,14:41, Roberta Langara, <Media omitted>
5649,2020-03-18,14:42, kirra, really?
5650,2020-03-18,14:42, kirra, so -13 is also an outlier?
5651,2020-03-18,14:42, Roberta Langara, <Media omitted>
5652,2020-03-18,14:43, Roberta Langara, So @17788855554  @12363340235  giving the nature of the question I think It does make difference the outlier and you should remove only 31
5653,2020-03-18,14:44, Roberta Langara, Doesn't make any sense reject in both answers
5654,2020-03-18,14:44, Kania Langara, Oh I just based it on boxplot
5655,2020-03-18,14:45, Kania Langara, I alr submitted it so 🤷
5656,2020-03-18,14:46, jaspreet cls canada, hmm
5657,2020-03-18,15:08, Roberta Langara, should be reject with outlier
5658,2020-03-18,15:08, Roberta Langara, fail to without
5659,2020-03-18,15:08, Roberta Langara, @kania if you feel so you can overwrite your subscription

5767,2020-03-19,00:36, Kania Langara, 😱
5768,2020-03-19,00:38, david langara, 😓 what a nightmare for doctors and nurses
5769,2020-03-19,00:38, kirra, Good thing im blood type O haha
5770,2020-03-19,00:38, kiran kumar cls, Mine too

5775,2020-03-19,00:39, Roberta Langara, A but there's not enough evidence
5776,2020-03-19,00:40, kirra, 🤣
5777,2020-03-19,00:41, david langara, There's almost not enough evidence for anything right now. This thing is getting worse by the minute and people are trying to figure it out.
5778,2020-03-19,00:41, Kania Langara, I'm just reading articles and I'm alr mentally drained.. can't imagine those on the front line working nonstop to fight the virus 😭
5779,2020-03-19,00:42, Vedant Langara, Wait till it spreads in India. I highly doubt the government would be able to control it or rather do anything at all.
5780,2020-03-19,00:42, kirra, ^ especially with that population density
5781,2020-03-19,00:42, Vedant Langara, Exactly.
5782,2020-03-19,00:42, Kania Langara, Did India close their borders?
5784,2020-03-19,00:43, Vedant Langara, They did
5785,2020-03-19,00:43, kirra, Is it crazy we have 8 deaths altogether in Canada... and 7 of it is in BC
5786,2020-03-19,00:44, Kania Langara, Because they keep telling ppl to self isolate
5787,2020-03-19,00:44, Vedant Langara, BC has older people with lower immunities. That has an effect.
5788,2020-03-19,00:45, Kania Langara, It's not going to work~ the virus spreads thru the vents etc. That's why they installed negative air pressure rooms for outbreaks.. idk what the govt are thinking
5789,2020-03-19,00:46, Kania Langara, Yeah but will the person really stay at home?
5790,2020-03-19,00:46, Kania Langara, Who can guarantee? Who's gonna get food for them?
5791,2020-03-19,00:47, Vedant Langara, That’s the whole point. What about people who don’t have a home!
5792,2020-03-19,00:47, david langara, It actually can stay in the air for a  while
5794,2020-03-19,00:48, Kania Langara, Yeap. Hk suspected that too when the whole apartment was infected after one person was tested positive. Then again it could be them touching contaminated surfaces
5795,2020-03-19,00:49, david langara, Nations have no other option than to keep their people in as much isolation and closing people businesses
5796,2020-03-19,00:49, Vedant Langara, Just stay safe and isolated guys. Go to work only if it doesn’t involve contact with people and take all precautions.
5797,2020-03-19,00:50, Kania Langara, Yeap 😭
5798,2020-03-19,00:50, david langara, We're headed into a global recession. Never a dull moment for us.
5799,2020-03-19,00:51, david langara, I'm already tired of staying home haha and it's been only a few days... Haha
5800,2020-03-19,00:51, Kania Langara, I love it!!
5801,2020-03-19,00:52, Kania Langara, 😂
5802,2020-03-19,00:52, david langara, So much speculation going around. Very dangerous
5804,2020-03-19,00:52, Kania Langara, But I'd much prefer to be in Singapore right now..
5805,2020-03-19,00:52, david langara, Haha so much for coming back on time after spring break
5806,2020-03-19,00:52, david langara, Haha and gold
5807,2020-03-19,00:54, Kania Langara, Hahah
5808,2020-03-19,00:54, Kania Langara, Everything is so cheap now!
5809,2020-03-19,00:54, kirra, Buy your stocks when it hits rock bttm
5810,2020-03-19,00:54, Kania Langara, But it will keep going down
5811,2020-03-19,00:55, david langara, Yes. Plan to retire early hahaha
5812,2020-03-19,00:55, Kania Langara, Until a vaccine is developed...
5813,2020-03-19,00:56, Kania Langara, I thought we at the point worst than the IMF 2008?
5814,2020-03-19,00:56, david langara, Oh Vedant. At this point is inevitable. The Rock has just hit the water . Wait for the waves
5815,2020-03-19,00:56, Kania Langara, Financial crisis I mean
5816,2020-03-19,00:57, david langara, So bad. The plunge is as bad if not even worse (and it's not over yet) AND so much more debt everywhere AND dozens of industries are being mutilated right now
5817,2020-03-19,00:58, david langara, All at the same time
5818,2020-03-19,00:58, david langara, Which was not the case in 2008
5819,2020-03-19,00:58, Vedant Langara, Netflix and Zoom Meetings will surely make tons of money
5820,2020-03-19,00:58, david langara, And toilet paper companies haha
5821,2020-03-19,00:59, kirra, Like i said recession is bad news for international students
5822,2020-03-19,1:00, kirra, Recession = Less Jobs = Less permanent residency visas
5823,2020-03-19,1:00, david langara, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/business/stock-market-coronavirus-federal-reserve.html
5824,2020-03-19,1:03, david langara, Let's hope for the best.
5825,2020-03-19,1:05, Vedant Langara, Hahah agreed
5826,2020-03-19,1:05, david langara, I think you guys will have an edge when applying because of your skills
5827,2020-03-19,1:06, Vedant Langara, New Job Role = Covid-19 Analyst
5828,2020-03-19,1:06, kirra, We can form a regression model
5829,2020-03-19,1:07, david langara, 😂
5830,2020-03-19,1:08, kirra, Use median age as predictor
5831,2020-03-19,1:08, kirra, As well as percentage of people with blood type A
5832,2020-03-19,1:09, david langara, Probably the data will satisfy all assumptions haha
5835,2020-03-19,1:10, Roberta Langara, Brazil is insanely growing
5836,2020-03-19,1:11, david langara, They are already having a hard time. This is the last thing they need
5837,2020-03-19,1:12, Roberta Langara, Yes the economy is collapsing
5838,2020-03-19,1:13, Roberta Langara, With the covid-19 a lot will suffer
5839,2020-03-19,1:13, Roberta Langara, I'm having a tough time to stay focused and doing our activities
5840,2020-03-19,1:13, Roberta Langara, Like college activities
5841,2020-03-19,1:14, Roberta Langara, Because I'm way too conected and I've been reading all the corona news
5842,2020-03-19,1:14, Roberta Langara, Sometimes I feel kinda panicking
5843,2020-03-19,1:14, kirra, <Media omitted>
5844,2020-03-19,1:14, Roberta Langara, Then I chill a little then panic  again
5845,2020-03-19,1:16, david langara, Definately an unprecedented challenge for many students all across the country
5846,2020-03-19,1:16, david langara, And meanwhile the Canadian money is plummeting 😓😓😓
5847,2020-03-19,1:17, Roberta Langara, https://www.bing.com/covid
5848,2020-03-19,1:17, kirra, Every currency is plummeting right now except USD... even euro is going down
5849,2020-03-19,1:18, Roberta Langara, When facing global fear everyone look for stability  this means US dollars and Us treasure notes
5850,2020-03-19,1:19, david langara, Can you send us an updated one ? Haha
5851,2020-03-19,1:19, kirra, Ill find some

5853,2020-03-19,1:20, david langara, Haha just very interesting to see the comparison
5854,2020-03-19,1:22, david langara, Another worrisome thing is the crime. Crisis time = desperation = crime where there's a lot of corruption

5862,2020-03-19,1:27, Roberta Langara, Vatican is in Italy  🙃 I don't want to live there
5863,2020-03-19,1:27, Roberta Langara, All the other except Vatican are poor countries so probably they are not testing

6098,2020-03-20,23:13, Amir Langara, I’m losing faith in WHO. Was completely useless in Corona case to say the least. Admired Iranian health system and was late to react and issue warning. Ignored early warning issued by Hong Kong in favor of Chinese government.
6099,2020-03-20,23:17, Kania Langara, But they claimed that countries were not doing anything despite their warning

6761,2020-03-30,17:21, naval clss, If the class is allowed to give exams🙊🙊
6762,2020-03-30,17:23, Roberta Langara, She could easily avoid this by call it of the semester with project and assignments instead of that midterm.
6763,2020-03-30,17:23, Roberta Langara, In fact all of the instructors should change for assignments this kinda of online exam in word will never work
6764,2020-03-30,17:24, Roberta Langara, They will need to find a better way to do this

6804,2020-03-31,16:44, jaspreet cls canada, we should only use the tables provided by her
6805,2020-03-31,16:45, jaspreet cls canada, also remember to submit pdf + word document
6806,2020-03-31,16:49, kirra, Yeah a lot of people used online calculator for the last midterm instead of tables from her
6807,2020-03-31,16:53, Edward, <Media omitted>
6808,2020-03-31,16:53, kirra, But in her solution on d2l
6809,2020-03-31,16:53, kirra, Its the same number as online calculator
6810,2020-03-31,16:55, kirra, Kinda inconsistent
6811,2020-03-31,16:55, kirra, <Media omitted>
6812,2020-03-31,16:55, kirra, 2.17 is not in our f table
6813,2020-03-31,16:56, kirra, Its between 2.11 and 2.17
6814,2020-03-31,16:56, Amir Langara, you’re talking about what’s allowed and what’s not as if you’re gonna abide by it.
6815,2020-03-31,16:56, Edward, <Media omitted>
6816,2020-03-31,16:56, kirra, Yeah but that is for df 24
6817,2020-03-31,16:57, kirra, The df is 25 and 28
6818,2020-03-31,16:57, Edward, there is a similar symbol
6819,2020-03-31,16:58, Edward, approximate
6820,2020-03-31,16:58, kirra, Yeah i guess but in class she said to give the range so i assumed it was between df 24 and 30
6821,2020-03-31,16:59, Edward, i think it is fine to use range or approximation in this question

6858,2020-02-04,18:57, arsh langara, it has to be a convincing one
6861,2020-02-04,18:58, arsh langara, PDD-DA 19
6862,2020-02-04,18:59, Prerna Langara, I am in😁

6864,2020-02-04,19:04, aditi jaswal, 🤟 yesss
6865,2020-02-04,19:05, arsh langara, to whom to write?
6866,2020-02-04,19:08, kirra, how much waiver r u expecting?
6867,2020-02-04,19:10, arsh langara, <Media omitted>
6868,2020-02-04,19:11, arsh langara, its 8k this term
6871,2020-02-04,19:11, tuli class, Yea
6872,2020-02-04,19:12, kirra, 5k discount
6873,2020-02-04,19:12, Beth Langara, more than half is not reasonable
6874,2020-02-04,19:13, kirra, 5k multiply by 28 is 140k
6875,2020-02-04,19:13, kirra, we are not the only international students in this college
6876,2020-02-04,19:13, jasman cls, Your expectations are too high!😂
6877,2020-02-04,19:13, arsh langara, They received 140k 
6881,2020-02-04,19:14, kirra, 140k is for all international students in Langara?
6882,2020-02-04,19:15, arsh langara, yeah
6883,2020-02-04,19:15, jasman cls, 😠
6884,2020-02-04,19:15, Prerna Langara, They're anyway going to save so much of infrastructural costs this semester
6885,2020-02-04,19:15, kirra, so there is 6300 international students in langara
6886,2020-02-04,19:16, kirra, 140k divided by 6300
6887,2020-02-04,19:16, arsh langara, thts why i said a decent 3k off
6888,2020-02-04,19:16, kirra, each student will get 22 dollars
6889,2020-02-04,19:16, kirra, discount
6890,2020-02-04,19:16, Prerna Langara, 😅😅
6891,2020-02-04,19:16, kirra, yeahhh
6892,2020-02-04,19:16, kirra, exactly
6893,2020-02-04,19:16, kirra, 140k is peanuts
6894,2020-02-04,19:17, Prerna Langara, It's not like they've got only the specified amount of funds.
6895,2020-02-04,19:18, arsh langara, + 5k (variable) from each 6300
6897,2020-02-04,19:18, arsh langara, and all this to post material on D2L
6898,2020-02-04,19:19, arsh langara, even $22 is more i feel😑
6899,2020-02-04,19:19, vasu, If we all unite may be they has to wave off some fees
6900,2020-02-04,19:19, vasu, If we all dont pay what they ask
6901,2020-02-04,19:21, Beth Langara, agree...

6906,2020-02-04,19:22, jaspreet cls canada, 26 / total
6907,2020-02-04,19:22, jaspreet cls canada, is very small sample set
6908,2020-02-04,19:22, jaspreet cls canada, Michael said it is the IE department who needs to fix this fees thing
6909,2020-02-04,19:24, aditi jaswal, Let's give a try.. anyway we have to pay the exact amount but a little try won't hurt..
6910,2020-02-04,19:24, arsh langara, Still 18 days to go

7031,2020-04-04,21:21, jaspreet cls canada, yes yes
7032,2020-04-04,21:24, cici, i mean how can she tell if we are using the internet or not?
7033,2020-04-04,21:25, cici, We are supposed to do everything on laptop
7034,2020-04-04,21:25, tuli class, useless
7035,2020-04-04,21:25, kirra, Exactly
7036,2020-04-04,21:25, kirra, Lol
7037,2020-04-04,21:26, Roberta Langara, How she will know if we are using internet
7038,2020-04-04,21:26, Roberta Langara, This doesn't make any sense
7039,2020-04-04,21:26, kirra, I mean if she decides that we do screensharing instead of
7040,2020-04-04,21:26, kirra, Camera
7041,2020-04-04,21:27, cici, also how she will know if we are talking to each other?
7042,2020-04-04,21:27, kirra, Some people have 2 laptops
7043,2020-04-04,21:27, kirra, Haha
7044,2020-04-04,21:27, navjot canada, 😂😂
7045,2020-04-04,21:27, cici, you are typing too much words?
7046,2020-04-04,21:27, Roberta Langara, The sad part is that I'll need to change I can't stay on camera in my pjs
7047,2020-04-04,21:27, navjot canada, Exactly
7048,2020-04-04,21:27, cici, I don't think so
7049,2020-04-04,21:28, kirra, Nope
7050,2020-04-04,21:28, cici, also we have to look at each other's face through the whole exam
7051,2020-04-04,21:28, cici, it will make me laugh
7052,2020-04-04,21:29, Roberta Langara, Actually don't because I'll stay looking to my word
7053,2020-04-04,21:29, Roberta Langara, And let the zoom minimized
7054,2020-04-04,21:29, cici, a lot of instructor did this
7055,2020-04-04,21:30, cici, i guess she just want you to know that she is watching you
7056,2020-04-04,21:30, rashman canada, Some people have internet issues too 🙄🙄
7057,2020-04-04,21:30, Vedant Langara, She can piss off.
7058,2020-04-04,21:31, Amir Langara, The big brother is watching you comrade
7059,2020-04-04,21:33, Amir Langara, She put so much unwanted stress on me this term and she continues to do so up until this very last moment. Just can’t take it anymore.
7060,2020-04-04,21:33, tuli class, yeah
7061,2020-04-04,21:34, harshad cls, <Media omitted>
7062,2020-04-04,21:35, cici, Highly agree
7063,2020-04-04,21:39, kirra, What if ur laptop doesnt have a camera haha 🤣
7064,2020-04-04,21:39, tuli class, exactly
7065,2020-04-04,21:39, tuli class, hahah
7066,2020-04-04,21:48, arsh langara, zoom runs in same browser
7068,2020-04-04,21:49, kirra, ?
7069,2020-04-04,21:49, aditi jaswal, 😣
7070,2020-04-04,21:50, arsh langara, i mean if anybody googles
7071,2020-04-04,21:50, kirra, But i use the zoom app
7072,2020-04-04,21:50, arsh langara, i am assuming this 🤔
7073,2020-04-04,21:50, jasman cls, Yeah
7074,2020-04-04,21:50, harshad cls, 😂😂
7075,2020-04-04,21:50, kirra, Not browser based
7076,2020-04-04,21:50, harshad cls, We reject your hypothesis
7077,2020-04-04,21:51, kirra, And conclude that zoom does not share cookies with emmap
7078,2020-04-04,21:51, arsh langara, even through app it launches in browser no?
7079,2020-04-04,21:51, harshad cls, No
7080,2020-04-04,21:51, kirra, Well she gave link
7081,2020-04-04,21:51, cici, she is going to check our cookies?
7082,2020-04-04,21:52, arsh langara, she is insane
7083,2020-04-04,21:52, arsh langara, she ll go to any extent
7084,2020-04-04,21:52, Vedant Langara, She can’t do it without written consent. That’s the law.
7085,2020-04-04,21:53, kirra, We can sue langara if that happens
7086,2020-04-04,21:53, kirra, Make some dollars
7087,2020-04-04,21:53, aditi jaswal, 🤣🤣
7088,2020-04-04,21:53, Vedant Langara, Dollars X 2
7089,2020-04-04,21:54, Vedant Langara, Nope. Runs in the background.
7090,2020-04-04,21:54, kirra, I am wondering if she meant d2l lock
7091,2020-04-04,21:54, Vedant Langara, Otherwise how do plan to work on your exam
7092,2020-04-04,21:54, arsh langara, woth camera on
7093,2020-04-04,21:54, Vedant Langara, *do you
7094,2020-04-04,21:54, Vedant Langara, Yes
7095,2020-04-04,21:55, cici, she wants us to mute our self
7096,2020-04-04,21:55, cici, even we are talking
7097,2020-04-04,21:55, kirra, Wait she said cant use the internet
7098,2020-04-04,21:55, cici, she can't hear us
7099,2020-04-04,21:55, harshad cls, We can wear a mask 😂
7100,2020-04-04,21:55, kirra, Means we can turnoff our wifi
7101,2020-04-04,21:56, Vedant Langara, Hahaha
7102,2020-04-04,21:57, cici, then zoom will only show your profile photo to her
7103,2020-04-04,21:57, Roberta Langara, The only thing that intrigued me is that she said before open book and now no internet
7104,2020-04-04,21:58, Roberta Langara, I'll just open zoom on firefox and my exam I can google it stuff on google chrome
7105,2020-04-04,21:59, kirra, But she said no internet.. using zoom is technically using the internet we can argue with her that way...
7106,2020-04-04,21:59, Roberta Langara, Then I skip the cookies problem
7107,2020-04-04,21:59, kirra, Is there really a cookies issue
7108,2020-04-04,21:59, Roberta Langara, But I don't think she's really check this
7109,2020-04-04,21:59, Roberta Langara, And even if this is possible shareable with her
7110,2020-04-04,22:00, Roberta Langara, Because there's privacy issues regarding this right?
7111,2020-04-04,22:00, kirra, Imma try and click on the link now
7112,2020-04-04,22:02, tuli class, it seems like usual meeting
7113,2020-04-04,22:02, kirra, Yeah its like a normal meetinng
7114,2020-04-04,22:03, jasman cls, What if she asks us to share screen
7115,2020-04-04,22:03, tuli class, only one can do at a time
7116,2020-04-04,22:03, jasman cls, No
7117,2020-04-04,22:03, jasman cls, Multiple participants can share at the same time
7118,2020-04-04,22:03, tuli class, and i dont think she wants class to see answers
7119,2020-04-04,22:04, jasman cls, <Media omitted>
7120,2020-04-04,22:04, kirra, Then we can use 2 laptops
7121,2020-04-04,22:04, kirra, 1 laptop will be the screen share and the other laptop will be the non screen share one... where we can google
7122,2020-04-04,22:05, Roberta Langara, But she will see you moving from one laptop to another
7123,2020-04-04,22:05, Roberta Langara, I kust think that you guys are overthinking this
7124,2020-04-04,22:06, Amir Langara, run separate zoom with the person you want to cheat with and silently share screens
7125,2020-04-04,22:06, kirra, If we screenshare she can only see the screenshare not camera
7126,2020-04-04,22:07, jasman cls, Can a person share screen and camera simultaneously on zoom?
7127,2020-04-04,22:07, kirra, Not sure about this if someone has experience lmk
7128,2020-04-04,22:07, kirra, I dont think so though
7129,2020-04-04,22:08, Roberta Langara, She'll not ask you to screenshare
7130,2020-04-04,22:08, tuli class, if we share the screen ppl can see their paper
7131,2020-04-04,22:08, tuli class, its not practical
7132,2020-04-04,22:08, jasman cls, 😂😂😂
7133,2020-04-04,22:08, Roberta Langara, The thing that bothered her is that people communicate
7134,2020-04-04,22:08, Roberta Langara, She will watching in zoom
7135,2020-04-04,22:08, kirra, 🤣
7136,2020-04-04,22:08, jasman cls, Only Emma can see
7137,2020-04-04,22:08, kirra, I forgot about this
7138,2020-04-04,22:08, Roberta Langara, Just to make sure that you're not talking to anyone
7139,2020-04-04,22:09, kirra, You can also creats a video loop of urself
7140,2020-04-04,22:09, kirra, Create*
7141,2020-04-04,22:10, kirra, So she thinks its u lol but its just a video loop haha
7142,2020-04-04,22:10, tuli class, hahahah
7143,2020-04-04,22:10, Roberta Langara, Study will be lesser work than create a loop video
7144,2020-04-04,22:10, kirra, 👆
7145,2020-04-04,22:10, kirra, True that
7146,2020-04-04,22:11, navjot canada, If we will share our screens then we are able to see everyone's answer right?
7147,2020-04-04,22:11, navjot canada, Because we will work in word
7148,2020-04-04,22:11, Amir Langara, what’s the overall minimum grade to pass?
7149,2020-04-04,22:11, tuli class, 60
7150,2020-04-04,22:12, jasman cls, C
7151,2020-04-04,22:12, tuli class, with 50 for finals
7152,2020-04-04,22:12, kirra, 58% overall
7153,2020-04-04,22:12, kirra, 50% for finals
7154,2020-04-04,22:23, cici, What does 50% for final means
7155,2020-04-04,22:23, cici, You have to reach 50% in finals then you are eligible to pass?
7156,2020-04-04,22:24, Amir Langara, supposedly
7157,2020-04-04,22:24, kirra, <Media omitted>
7158,2020-04-04,22:26, cici, Hahahahahahah
7159,2020-04-04,22:33, Roberta Langara, Yes
7160,2020-04-04,22:34, Roberta Langara, But I have a friend who passed in financial accounting without getting 50% in the final
7161,2020-04-04,22:34, Roberta Langara, So I never now if this rule is actually true
7162,2020-04-04,22:34, Roberta Langara, Know*
7163,2020-04-04,22:41, kirra, 😢
7164,2020-04-04,22:42, cici, 😿

7717,2020-04-17,7:10, dharun cls, So we all just mailed him?
7718,2020-04-17,7:11, dharun cls, Did he extend the time later last night?
7719,2020-04-17,8:54, Roberta Langara, Don't know
7720,2020-04-17,8:54, Roberta Langara, He replied ?
7721,2020-04-17,9:27, Amir Langara," ""U-Pass BC program suspended as of May 1"""
7722,2020-04-17,9:29, harshad cls, 😂
7723,2020-04-17,9:30, Roberta Langara, I was thinking
7724,2020-04-17,9:30, Roberta Langara, Khurram played us
7725,2020-04-17,9:31, Roberta Langara, He behave all term as Mr. Nice Guy
7726,2020-04-17,9:31, Roberta Langara, And at the very end that final exam
7727,2020-04-17,9:31, Roberta Langara, Damn
7728,2020-04-17,9:32, nikita langara, True
7729,2020-04-17,9:33, Amir Langara, The problem with this exam was its dependency on q1 which required a bit of experience with data structure
7730,2020-04-17,9:33, kirra, Michael gave him a lecture on how to be mean to us because of the emma incident haha
7731,2020-04-17,9:35, Roberta Langara, The other questions I agree
7732,2020-04-17,9:35, Roberta Langara, But question one
7733,2020-04-17,9:35, Roberta Langara, Was a freaking nightmare
7734,2020-04-17,9:35, Amir Langara, now most of us got stuck in q1 and panicked which influenced the whole thing
7735,2020-04-17,9:35, Amir Langara, and we could not simply move on from q1
7736,2020-04-17,9:36, Roberta Langara, And if you don't get question one right you don't have the df_detail that is needed to do the other questions properly
7737,2020-04-17,9:37, naval clss, Also the memory issue
7738,2020-04-17,9:38, Amir Langara, did anybody else encounter the memory issue?
7739,2020-04-17,9:38, naval clss, 8gb Ram was unable to handle so many files/df
7740,2020-04-17,9:40, Roberta Langara, All the time I had that hourglass on the top
7741,2020-04-17,9:42, vasu, In my case some of my command never runs nor give a error
7742,2020-04-17,9:42, vasu, Lets hope he consider our emails
7743,2020-04-17,9:42, Roberta Langara, Guys and business?
7744,2020-04-17,9:42, Roberta Langara, Still unable to register
7745,2020-04-17,9:43, Roberta Langara, How will I know how much to pay?
7746,2020-04-17,9:45, kirra, Add 1700 CAD to whatever u have to pay now
7747,2020-04-17,9:45, vasu, Its (565*3)=1695
7748,2020-04-17,9:45, Roberta Langara, Michael didn't solve this yet
7749,2020-04-17,9:46, Roberta Langara, Sometimes I ask myself what the heck he does

7803,2020-04-17,20:31, Roberta Langara, Any news from our dearest instructor?
7804,2020-04-17,20:32, kiran kumar cls, Ohhhh my God he is deadly

7811,2020-04-18,12:13, Roberta Langara, Just this nothing else
7812,2020-04-18,12:15, aditi jaswal, He never replies to mails
7813,2020-04-18,12:16, aditi jaswal, I messaged him once regarding project submission.. he didn't reply to that even but cleared my doubt in announcement only..
7814,2020-04-18,12:18, rashman canada, True

7827,2020-04-20,10:37, Amir Langara, Canada’s oil price just turned negative. They now pay you to take their oil. Anyone has any extra bucket I could borrow?
7828,2020-04-20,11:05, dharun cls, Should we mail Michael regarding the CPSC exam?

7863,2020-04-21,19:08, naval clss, Is it mandatory to get 50% in final exam???
7864,2020-04-21,19:12, Roberta Langara, It supposed to be
7865,2020-04-21,19:12, Roberta Langara, But I've never learn about someone failing because this rule
7866,2020-04-21,19:12, kirra, Dont worry about it
7867,2020-04-21,19:12, Roberta Langara, And he said that he improved the grades
7868,2020-04-21,19:12, kirra, He only cares about overall
7869,2020-04-21,19:13, naval clss, I hope so
7870,2020-04-21,19:14, kirra, As long as ur overall grade is 55% u will pass
7871,2020-04-21,19:34, Nicky Langara, Anyone has Khurram phone number? I need to call him as he added wrong grades for me
7872,2020-04-21,19:40, Kania Langara, Same... You guys might wanna double check his calculation
7873,2020-04-21,19:41, kirra, Which one?
7874,2020-04-21,19:41, kirra, Did he particularly miscalculate?
7875,2020-04-21,19:41, Kania Langara, CPSC overall
7876,2020-04-21,19:41, Kania Langara, Idk if it's rounding error?
7877,2020-04-21,19:43, kirra, He hasnt done overall grade?
7878,2020-04-21,19:43, kirra, Yet
7879,2020-04-21,19:43, Nicky Langara, I mean final exam grade
7880,2020-04-21,19:43, Kania Langara, Oh right.. I mixed up overall grade and final grade 🙊
7881,2020-04-21,19:43, Kania Langara, Sorry for confusion
7882,2020-04-21,19:44, kirra, Dont look at the letter grade he put in the right side
7883,2020-04-21,19:45, kirra, Just look at the points
7884,2020-04-21,19:45, Nicky Langara, Yes I did
7885,2020-04-21,19:46, Nicky Langara, I mean I received B+ 24/35 but as what he wrote in his annoucement I should have A- 27/35. So I think it is typing mistake
7886,2020-04-21,19:47, kirra, ohh A- is supposed to be the overall grade
7887,2020-04-21,19:47, kirra, ^^^ he is talking about overall grade in this one
7888,2020-04-21,19:48, kirra, so he will bump you up from A- to A
7889,2020-04-21,19:48, Nicky Langara, Uhm yes it makes sense
7890,2020-04-21,19:49, Vedant Langara, The grades are calculated by the system. Khurram only puts in the scores. Just make sure your scores and totals are correct.
7891,2020-04-21,19:51, Vedant Langara, He most likely won’t. I think that marks increase offer was only for those who got a lesser grade than C. But I hope I’m wrong.
7892,2020-04-21,19:53, vasu, Do Khurram update overall grade?
7893,2020-04-21,19:53, Nicky Langara, Yes I think I misunderstand between overall score and final score
7894,2020-04-21,19:53, kirra, he said he will add for everyone
7895,2020-04-21,19:53, kirra, no but u can calculate your score
7896,2020-04-21,21:22, vasu, Do you get chance to call khurram?
7897,2020-04-21,23:23, Nicky Langara, No I dont have his number
7898,2020-04-22,00:14, kirra, He added 3% to everyone
7899,2020-04-22,00:15, kirra, Calculate ur total now

9375,2020-05-19,15:01, Roberta Langara, All the entry level jobs that I've found ask for 1 or 2 y of experience
9376,2020-05-19,15:06, cici, Especially for data analyst
9377,2020-05-19,15:07, Roberta Langara, Am I crazy? All the indeed job postings for junior level ask for 1 or 2 y of experience.
9378,2020-05-19,15:08, Roberta Langara, And not always we can transfer personal projects as experience
9379,2020-05-19,15:08, Roberta Langara, Sometimes they want experience working

9398,2020-05-19,15:19, dharun cls, true that
9399,2020-05-19,15:20, rashman canada, 😅
9400,2020-05-19,15:21, jasman cls, The duration of pgwp will be the same with or without work term?
9401,2020-05-19,15:26, dharun cls, I had the same question @919781706053​.
9402,2020-05-19,15:27, tuli class, i asked that from IE
9403,2020-05-19,15:27, tuli class, they said work term is considered as a part of ur course
9404,2020-05-19,15:29, kirra, So its better to go direct PGWP
9405,2020-05-19,15:30, tuli class, yes
9406,2020-05-19,15:31, jasman cls, Yes and I don’t think there is any point to do work term if the duration of pgwp will be the same
9407,2020-05-19,15:31, jasman cls, Why to pay langara for finding a job ourselves
9408,2020-05-19,15:39, jasman cls, Yeah it’s more work
9409,2020-05-19,15:39, jasman cls, And we have to pay for it😂
9410,2020-05-19,15:40, Roberta Langara, if there's n difference on pgwp
9411,2020-05-19,15:40, Roberta Langara, does not make sense to pay
9412,2020-05-19,15:40, jasman cls, And it will just delay our graduation
9413,2020-05-19,16:28, kirra, Link?

10532,2020-04-06,16:11, kirra, And why does a flat loading mean that the component on that loading represent the average yield over the maturities
10533,2020-04-06,16:12, naval clss, From where u r studying???🤯

10548,2020-04-06,16:33, cici, She said we don’t know what should be submitted
10549,2020-04-06,16:33, dharun cls, So we might have to redo
10550,2020-04-06,16:33, Roberta Langara, Mock test to show how it supposed to be
10551,2020-04-06,16:33, cici, So she is going to give us a mock test and we submit to her
10552,2020-04-06,16:33, Roberta Langara, Because we did a bad job in assignment 1

10576,2020-04-06,16:42, kiran kumar cls, why is she yelling most excited or frustrated

11090,2020-09-06,18:48, Roberta Langara, She was praising me for the previous work I was able to do a decent work before because I had time
11091,2020-09-06,18:49, Roberta Langara, How I supposed to do this in 55 m
11092,2020-09-06,18:49, Roberta Langara, It was awfull
11093,2020-09-06,18:49, rashman canada, 😅

11116,2020-09-06,18:57, harshad cls, I was angry too. I don't understand how a professional can to talk to their students like that. Our demands aren't realistic
11117,2020-09-06,18:57, vasu, Harshad you put our problem in really nice wording
11118,2020-09-06,18:57, Roberta Langara, She basically implied that we are all crying babies
11119,2020-09-06,18:58, vasu, Why she always deflecting questions to other students.
11120,2020-09-06,18:58, Roberta Langara, She was like I don't wanna now your personal problems

11124,2020-09-06,19:00, tuli class, Bitch
11125,2020-09-06,19:00, Roberta Langara, I was kinda of embarassed that she told me to talk about my work

11127,2020-09-06,19:00, Roberta Langara, puts you in a bad position
11128,2020-09-06,19:01, dharun cls, She can't teach us how to make a report
11129,2020-09-06,19:01, dharun cls, Instead she is making roberta amdt Kania to do what she is getting paid to do

11138,2020-09-06,19:05, Roberta Langara, but Monica is literally making things impossible for us
11139,2020-09-06,19:06, Roberta Langara, I think she has the idea of giving us a hard time to make us better
11140,2020-09-06,19:06, Roberta Langara, but you need to be reasonable
11141,2020-09-06,19:08, Kania Langara, I agree. Asian style.. I always had these teachers in school and somehow we were scared getting humiliated in class so we studied better.. hahaha not sure if that'll work in university

11149,2020-09-06,19:17, Roberta Langara, Being pragmatic we need to make her give us actual assignments rather this in class stuff
11150,2020-09-06,19:19, Roberta Langara, Because a lot of technical problems could happen
11151,2020-09-06,21:09, cici, .....nightmare in the past
11152,2020-09-06,21:22, Roberta Langara, Guys quick question

12621,2020-06-23,18:06, Amir Langara, This session breaks the most Whatsapp messages sent during a lecture.
12622,2020-06-23,18:06, vasu, Thats why he is so curious
12623,2020-06-23,18:07, aditi jaswal, There's no other reason to date her😏🤣
12624,2020-06-23,18:08, vasu, Good Choice bro

12629,2020-06-23,18:09, jasman cls, Canada*
12630,2020-06-23,18:10, jasman cls, I don’t think she has
12631,2020-06-23,18:10, kirra, yes but probably Langara sponsored her PR already
12632,2020-06-23,18:10, kirra, by now
12633,2020-06-23,18:10, kiran kumar cls, What a waste
12634,2020-06-23,18:10, jasman cls, Oh then we can expect to see her in next sem also🙄

12656,2020-06-24,00:23, vivek reddy, not including online*
12657,2020-06-24,00:23, vivek reddy, that means we are not eligible I guess
12658,2020-06-24,00:24, jasman cls, But there are some online courses
12659,2020-06-24,00:24, jasman cls, Our courses are not online
12660,2020-06-24,00:24, jasman cls, Idk😛

12662,2020-06-24,11:52, Amir Langara, it should change to “successfully loaded”
12663,2020-06-24,11:52, jaspreet cls canada, ok
12664,2020-06-24,11:53, jaspreet cls canada, This means it is taking time to load in my machine
12665,2020-06-24,11:53, Amir Langara, maybe
12666,2020-06-24,11:53, jaspreet cls canada, any other alternatives to this approach
12667,2020-06-24,11:54, Vedant Langara, Try running
12670,2020-06-24,11:55, Vedant Langara, If that doesn’t work

12677,2020-06-24,11:58, jaspreet cls canada, yes yes
12678,2020-06-24,11:59, Vedant Langara, import pandas as pd
12684,2020-06-24,11:59, jaspreet cls canada, will try again

12693,2020-06-24,15:35, Amir Langara, It seems we can't simply use the way he has mentioned in his pdf
12694,2020-06-24,15:36, vasu, True/
12695,2020-06-24,15:36, Amir Langara, the function must be a javascript-ish style:
12696,2020-06-24,15:36, Amir Langara, slider.callback = CustomJS(
12708,2020-06-24,15:38, naval clss, Yup
12709,2020-06-24,15:38, Amir Langara, It maybe a good idea to ask him to demonstrate it himself
12710,2020-06-24,15:38, naval clss, But cannot show output in notebook
12711,2020-06-24,15:38, naval clss, it displays in html
12712,2020-06-24,15:39, naval clss, also port number 5006 should be free
12713,2020-06-24,15:39, naval clss, Because this file gets deployed only in that port
12714,2020-06-24,15:39, Amir Langara, 👍
12715,2020-06-24,15:39, Amir Langara, I hope Jas is satisfied now
12716,2020-06-24,15:40, Amir Langara, Let's hope he doesn't ask for a slider in the exam 🙌

12960,2020-06-29,10:03, Kania Langara, But that's still crazy to get 50% deducted!!
12961,2020-06-29,10:03, Kania Langara, Ooohh midterm!

12964,2020-06-29,10:04, Kania Langara, Same instructions were mentioned for both Midterm and assignment
12965,2020-06-29,10:05, Kania Langara," ""Last_name_First_name_StudentID.docx"""

12975,2020-06-29,10:09, kirra, 50% grade deduction for not using docx
12976,2020-06-29,10:09, kirra, Yes
12977,2020-06-29,10:10, Roberta Langara, Even if she posted a disclaimer is too mucjmh of deduction
12978,2020-06-29,10:10, Roberta Langara, Not fair
12979,2020-06-29,10:11, Roberta Langara, I didn't have this problem but  I can see that's not fair or reasonable
