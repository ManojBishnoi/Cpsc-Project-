2019-11-27,1900-01-01 10:47:00,Vasu, She didn't tell anything
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:11:00, Naval, I have uploaded in individual feedback section of assignments
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:12:00,Vasu, Can anyone send what creteria she want for feedback

2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:25:00, Naval, And this will be used to mark you
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:25:00, Roberta, Yes
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:26:00, Kirra, She doesnt care if u give bad grades to ur team mate
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:26:00, Kirra, She is not gonna mark ur team mate down for that
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:26:00, Roberta, But we don't have to do our own feedback
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:26:00, Kirra, Yepp
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:26:00, Kirra, But even if my team mate gives me 5 0s
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:26:00, Roberta, you just have to feedback your team mates and she is going to evaluate based on the rubric
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:26:00, Kirra, Shes not gonna minus points for
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:27:00, Roberta, if you really aplied the rules of giving feedback
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:27:00, Kirra, Yep
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:28:00, Naval, It’s still confusing
2019-11-27,1900-01-01 11:28:00, Naval, So🤞🤞

2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:38:00, Kirra, Lol
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:39:00, Kirra, I thought we only have presentation and summary report due
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:39:00,Vasu, We may get extension in summary report
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:39:00,Vasu, Sure
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:40:00, Kirra, Ohh until sunday? @16047219059
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:40:00, Kirra, I thought she said shes at most gonna give us 2 day extension
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:40:00, Kirra, Which is useless cuz we have CPSC on friday anyway
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:44:00,Vasu, After CPSC exam u don't have any work to do
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:44:00,Vasu, So you can do it freely
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:45:00, Kirra, Yepp
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:45:00, Kirra, Hopefully she gives the extension
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 16:45:00, Kirra, Cuz she said last time shes only gonna give until thursday at most
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:25:00, Naval, For this Dana Project
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:25:00, Naval, What all we need to upload?
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:26:00, Naval, The only option available is Project Dataset
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:26:00, Kirra, I think u give it to her in person
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:26:00, Kirra, Shes in school rn i believe

2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:32:00, Kirra, Yep
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:32:00, Kirra, 11:59

2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:35:00, Kirra, Unless u r perfect and can make the video 7 minutes straight without editing
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:36:00, Naval, I think editing is not allowed in this
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:36:00, Kirra, Really?
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:36:00, Kirra, 🤔
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:36:00, Roberta, OMG I can't handle
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:36:00, Kirra, Thats going to be hard lol
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:37:00, Beth, i don't care if I am not.. 15% is not going to hurt that much
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:37:00, Roberta, It has to be like a TED talk
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:37:00, Naval, We don’t get 2 takes in a presentation 😅😅
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:37:00, Naval, Can anyone suggest a good location???
2019-11-28,1900-01-01 17:37:00, Roberta, but you can film as many as you wish

2019-12-03,1900-01-01 19:51:00, Kirra, Just trying to estimate how much i need to get for the finals
2019-12-03,1900-01-01 19:52:00, Nikita , Thanks a lot
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:28:00, Kirra, <Media omitted>
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:29:00, Kirra, The z i mean
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:29:00, Beth, the z score
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:29:00, Kirra, Did she calculate that herself?
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:29:00, Beth, yes
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:30:00, Kirra, How?
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:30:00, Kirra, Can u show?
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:31:00, Jasman, <Media omitted>
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:31:00, Kirra, I cant find that in formula sheet
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:31:00, Kirra, Its kinda scary
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:32:00, Kirra, So we have to memorize
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:32:00, Jasman, We can calculate
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:32:00, Kirra, Oh ok
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:32:00, Jasman, <Media omitted>
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:33:00, Jasman, You have to look z value at the probability 0.95
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:33:00, Beth, prob is .90
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:33:00, Beth, look for z score
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:34:00, Beth, <Media omitted>
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:35:00, Jasman, 0.95
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:36:00, Beth, i mean u can use .95 using her way..
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:37:00, Jasman, 0.95 would be between 0.9495 and 0.9505 which lies at  z 1.6 0.4 and 0.5
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:38:00, Jasman, So its 1.645 I think so😂
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:38:00, Beth, yes.. exactly
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 00:38:00, Kirra, Thx

2019-12-04,1900-01-01 08:52:00, Roberta, z critical for 95%
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 15:01:00, Arsh , its for 90%
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 15:02:00, Roberta, Yes you're write
2019-12-04,1900-01-01 15:02:00, Roberta, right

2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:05:00, Kirra, we cannot open too many notebooks?
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:06:00, Kirra, if we do we get an error notebook
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:06:00, Kirra, if we open it all at the same time i mean
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:07:00, Harshad, Ya the sustem slows down if too many books are open.
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:07:00, Kirra, so we have to open and close it
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:07:00, Harshad, Good practice.
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:10:00, Naval, Just shutdown the kernel and restart the notebook
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:10:00, Naval, No need to do restart the entire thing
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:10:00, Kirra, Yeahhh

2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:12:00, Kirra, If i open too many i mean

2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:12:00,Dharun, Is it a Mac thing?
2019-12-06,1900-01-01 10:13:00, Kirra, lol my laptop ram is not very strong

2020-01-14,1900-01-01 13:48:00, Roberta, but is the class today theoretical or laboratory? I'm thinking of staying home
2020-01-14,1900-01-01 13:48:00, Vedant , Theory I think. Apparently he thinks lab means a test or something lol
2020-01-14,1900-01-01 13:55:00,Dharun, It's ok Roberta
2020-01-14,1900-01-01 13:55:00,Dharun, If there is a test. We will inform you

2020-01-14,1900-01-01 14:15:00, Vedant , I bet he’ll say yes to that and then add “If everyone does well”

2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:14:00, Arsh , Was anybody else hoping it was 26th
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:14:00, Vedant , I wonder how you came up with that percentage :P
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:15:00, Prerna, Good point😁
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:16:00, Arsh , i calculated it with aplha=0.20
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:16:00,Rashman, 😅

2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:17:00, David, Hahaha 😂
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:18:00, David, The teacher must just be laughing his rear off when he sent the email and then delete it from d2l
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:18:00, Prerna," ""rear""😅😅"
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:20:00, Arsh , objects in the mirror are larger then they appear 😂
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:21:00, David, <Media omitted>

2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:21:00, Arsh , 🤣

2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:26:00, Kania, Eerr I also got that email
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:26:00, Kania, But I think someone in our class emailed him and he reply it being the 26th!!
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:27:00, Kania, Here
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:27:00, Arsh , oh yes 
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:29:00, David," Yes! Mmmmmm.... I wonder why he even used the word ""remind"" when he didn't even talk about it in class nor is it in his syllabus"
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:29:00, Kania, I don't think a midterm should be informed on a short notice
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:29:00, David, 🤨🤨🤨
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:30:00, Kania, 😤 exactly
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:30:00, David, Nope. I understand a quiz haha but not a midterm haha
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:30:00, David, The worst is that if we send him an email he'll take between 24 and 48hrs to reply according to my experience 😂😂
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:30:00, David, Ahhhh.... !
2020-02-08,1900-01-01 01:31:00, Kania, WHAAATT

2020-02-10,1900-01-01 17:56:00, Amir, Is it gonna be closed? like library and all?
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 18:02:00,Vasu, yesssssssssssssssss

2020-02-10,1900-01-01 19:20:00, Jaspreet, This is the registration link: 
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 19:23:00,Dharun," @12368883428 what did Khuram say about the ""pie"" question?"
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 19:23:00, Edward, Great question
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 19:23:00, Edward, I will clarify it tonight
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 19:23:00,Dharun, Hahaha...
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 19:24:00,Dharun, Oh great...
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 21:36:00,Dharun, Does anyone know how to get the R²a for 4.88.. from the DANA assignment 2
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 22:53:00, Kirra, R u talking about 4.88(f)?
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 22:57:00, Edward, R² ?!🤔
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 22:58:00, Kania, Isnt that just adjusted r-square? Isn't that in the R output?
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 23:00:00, Amir, I could not find it ir SAS regression output for that question either
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 23:00:00, Roberta, there is no output in the book for that question
2020-02-10,1900-01-01 23:00:00, Roberta, so I think we have to run the model
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 06:54:00,Dharun, I'm using sas and I'm not able to find that in SAS
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 06:55:00,Dharun, SAS output only gives R² and not adj-R²
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 08:10:00, Roberta, Gives you adjusted R
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 08:53:00,Vasu, Yes everytime you have this in output
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:02:00, Roberta, On the glm procedure we don't have adjusted r square just the regular
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:02:00, Roberta, And we should use glm
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:03:00, Roberta, Because is a quadratic regression
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:03:00, Roberta, But with the regular one you can get the adjusted
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:34:00, Arsh , sometimes i feel 
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:35:00, Roberta, Sometimes I feel that I'm in the wrong course
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:35:00, Roberta, 😂

2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:39:00, Arsh , wht the heck is glm
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:39:00, Arsh , 😶
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 09:39:00, Tuli , I think about this everyday
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 12:58:00, Jaspreet, in this python assignment
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 12:58:00, Jaspreet, <Media omitted>
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 12:59:00, Jaspreet, we need to explicitly convert data to percentages or there is some function for that
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:00:00,Dharun, (100*df['bla bla'].value_counts()[0]) / df.count()
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:01:00, Jaspreet, ok we need to do it by ourself :( Thanks
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:01:00,Dharun, Ji
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:02:00, Kirra, Whos going to class today?
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:10:00,Dharun, He will be teaching a new concept today
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:10:00,Dharun, Or at least that is what he said yesterday.
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:11:00,Dharun, So... me
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:21:00, Amir, i’m going. Have a message for Khurram?
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:26:00, Arsh , i too have a message for him
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:39:00, Amir, Utter and it shall be delivered.
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 13:39:00, Arsh , no anyways m coming😀

2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:31:00, Kirra, Our tuition will be 8500 next semester
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:32:00,Dharun, Are you sure though?
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:32:00,Dharun, Even for PDD?
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:32:00,Dharun, I heard it is not increasing for PDD
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:32:00, Kirra, I think we have more credits next semester
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:33:00, Kirra, Not because of tuition increase
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:33:00,Dharun, Oh then that's a different thing
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:34:00,Vasu, 🤨
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 15:44:00, Tuli , 😩
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 16:43:00, Naval, Do we have quiz today???
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 16:43:00, Arsh , no
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 16:43:00, Beth, no
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 16:43:00, Naval, Great👍
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 16:43:00, Naval, Thanks:)
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 16:43:00,Dharun, 👍
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 16:44:00, Kirra, he extended deadline to monday too
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Tuli , <Media omitted>
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:32:00, Kiran, For what
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:33:00, Tuli , avoid the area when heading home
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:35:00, Amir, how does he know my name?!
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:36:00, Amir, or anybody’s?!
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:36:00, Arsh , you mailed him for midterms
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:37:00, Amir, I didn’t attach a picture of me to that email 😄
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:53:00, Arsh , Then be happy
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 17:57:00, Amir, 😄
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:26:00,Dharun," Yeah...so I figured out how to do this. Incase anyone is still wondering. By using ""GLM"" you only get R² and getting Adj-R² from R² using formula is too mainstream. "
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Roberta, you have to use glm Dharum
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Roberta, actually for the first one does not make difference
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Roberta, but the last one that you have several predictors make
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:28:00,Dharun, Yeah for the other things yes..
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:28:00,Dharun, But if you only need Adj-R² then go with this approach.
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:28:00, Roberta, If you want to use glm procedure and get the adjusted r quared
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:28:00, Roberta, this is the syntax
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:29:00, Roberta, proc glmselect data=naval plot=CriterionPanel;
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:29:00, Vedant , I’m just using Linear Regression function from the task panel. Any ideas on that? 😅
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:34:00, Beth, proc reg data = NAVALBASE_new;
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:35:00, Beth, i got adj r2 for this code.. not sure if i am right
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:36:00, Beth, I use SAS
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:37:00, Vedant , No wonder companies are getting rid of SAS
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:42:00, Vedant , <Media omitted>
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 21:46:00,Dharun, I hope we *all* figure out a way to crack the midterm the same way we did this one.🤞🏼

2020-02-11,1900-01-01 22:07:00,Vasu, Now the regression model will be off less errors.
2020-02-11,1900-01-01 22:13:00, Kiran , 😅😅😅sleep well guys☺
2020-02-12,1900-01-01 01:51:00, Arsh , missed u 😝

2020-02-13,1900-01-01 12:30:00, Roberta, But I thought that we need to get the indexes for all the columns
2020-02-13,1900-01-01 12:30:00, Jaspreet, oh really in that case we need to use for loop

2020-02-13,1900-01-01 12:57:00,Dharun, Although I might have added int(x[:2])
2020-02-13,1900-01-01 12:57:00,Dharun, You are now getting a string
2020-02-13,1900-01-01 12:57:00, Kirra, Yeah u have to fill out some sort of form

2020-02-17,1900-01-01 00:22:00, Vedant , Put another bracket after 15000]
2020-02-17,1900-01-01 00:22:00, Vedant , It should be 15000]]

2020-02-17,1900-01-01 00:24:00, Vedant , The brackets are fine
2020-02-17,1900-01-01 00:24:00, Vedant , The answer is that they won’t travel at all
2020-02-17,1900-01-01 00:24:00, Vedant , That’s it
2020-02-17,1900-01-01 00:24:00, Vedant , This.

2020-02-17,1900-01-01 00:28:00, Roberta, I don't think that the questions are clear
2020-02-17,1900-01-01 10:55:00,Dharun, Can we access the column as a series?
2020-02-17,1900-01-01 10:55:00,Dharun, Can anyone help me?

2020-02-17,1900-01-01 11:09:00,Vasu, Is you use single square bracket...then it is series
2020-02-17,1900-01-01 11:10:00,Vasu, If it is double then its df
2020-02-17,1900-01-01 11:13:00,Dharun, Ok

2020-02-18,1900-01-01 16:57:00, Roberta, Maybe you didn't phrase the answer as they wanted
2020-02-18,1900-01-01 16:58:00,Vasu, She want exactly she taught
2020-02-18,1900-01-01 16:58:00,Dharun, That is why i want the assignments back

2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:12:00, Kiran , the model for which slope is more negative
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:12:00, Kiran , coz more negative slope means less stress
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:12:00, Kiran , nd more strength
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:16:00, Jaspreet, ok
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:19:00, Vedant , Hoop Pine
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:20:00, Vedant , Greater value of y-intercept means that fatigue resistence is higher when the bladr cycles are 0
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:21:00, Vedant , *blade
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:23:00, Jaspreet, now i am confused
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:24:00, Kiran , along y we have fatigue...but in qus they r talking about fatique resistant
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:24:00, Kiran , resistant means less stress
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:24:00, Kiran , ☺☺
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 11:32:00, Vedant , *reduces with

2020-02-22,1900-01-01 20:00:00, Roberta, I really think this time that doing a video were the easiest option
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 20:01:00,Dharun, The default size won't work. So I increased the width and did it from scratch.
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 20:01:00,Dharun, Easy for you to say. You are so confident.. I am like Chandler if there is a camera in front of me
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 20:01:00, Roberta, Spend all afternoon doing. Tomorrow is going to be all about Dana🙃
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 20:02:00, Roberta, She posted hw 2 grades
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 20:03:00, Roberta, CSpc instructor posted about project and about midterm
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 20:19:00, Beth, I feel that this is easier for me.. but dont know exactly how to start.. hahah

2020-02-22,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Kirra, 😫
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Kirra, Its too much work bruh just do audio for the whole thing
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 22:13:00, Cici, You can record a narration with slideshow
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 22:14:00, Cici, Don’t have to attach audio with PowerPoint. That’s a lot of work😑
2020-02-22,1900-01-01 22:23:00, Naval, I thought only PPT is enough

2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:51:00, Tuli , Anyone got answers for this slide? Given by emma?
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:52:00, Arsh , 1st is by global f test
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:54:00, Arsh , partial*
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:54:00, Arsh , @16047219059 ?
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:57:00, Vedant , Should be by individual t-test
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:58:00, Vedant , Second by partial f-test
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:58:00, Arsh , 🤯
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Vedant , That’s what I think :P
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Arsh , i read conducting individual t is not a good approach so use partial f 
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Arsh , 😕
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:00:00, Tuli , Nice
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:00:00, Tuli , Thankyou:)

2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:11:00, Vedant , Is it to test usefullness of the interactive model or the individual parameters?
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:17:00,Vasu, a) Global F test
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:17:00,Vasu, C is model writing
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:18:00, Tuli , thanks!

2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:34:00, Kirra, Why partial and not global?
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:35:00, Kirra, They didnt specify
2020-02-23,1900-01-01 22:35:00, Kirra, If they wanted to check all or some of the variables

2020-02-24,1900-01-01 01:10:00, Vedant , Are we allowed a printed cheatsheet or does it have to be handwritten?
2020-02-24,1900-01-01 01:10:00, Harshad, Either

2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:44:00, Jasman, He seems to be more tough than Estella 🤔
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:44:00, Roberta, Estella is passive agressive
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:44:00, Roberta, Emma is agressive agressive

2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:44:00,Dharun, You can't subract anything from 0
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:44:00, Jasman, That’s why I am saying😂
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:44:00, Jasman, And so many positive feedbacks for Estella
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:45:00, Roberta, Yeah I know

2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:47:00, Amir, Estella is like a quiet volcano covered with meadows of grass and flowers
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:47:00, Kirra, Haha
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:47:00, Vedant , My brain is dead. I have zero ideas right now
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:47:00, Aditi, Both the names start from 'E'. So both of them are equally bad.. end of discussion
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:47:00, Roberta, Even her co worker said that she's mean
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:48:00, Aditi, Saying someone who told me to change my idea..
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 21:48:00, Roberta, I just want the funny instructor

2020-02-26,1900-01-01 22:31:00, Kiran , but i think we dont have to worry about it
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 22:31:00,Dharun, II am thinking of adding images to fill up the page.
2020-02-26,1900-01-01 22:32:00, Jasman, Yeah one page is way more for me

2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:47:00,Dharun, YES!!!!!!
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:47:00, Roberta, Ok to not cancel classes (although I don't think is the best call)
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:47:00,Dharun, Friends from other college have their finals *online*
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:47:00, Roberta, But don't cancel this career event
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:47:00,Dharun, we are not even close to having our campus closed
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:47:00, Roberta, Is nuts
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:48:00, Roberta, They should go online with almost every course
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:48:00, Kania, They just keep wanting to believe the risks is low.. as always
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:48:00, Kirra, <Media omitted>
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:49:00, Roberta, To contain the spread is all about prevention
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:49:00, Kirra, These are the type of mask that you should be wearing
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:49:00, Roberta, So they are waiting someone got sick to stop classes
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:49:00, Roberta, But when someone discovers that ok I'm sick
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:50:00, Roberta, They already spreaded virus through the entire campus
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:50:00, Roberta, Also there are people who are very poor in hygiene
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:50:00, Kania, I think just don't touch your face before washing your hands
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:50:00, Kania, Totally!! Ppl on the buses and trains still cough yawns sneezes w/o covering their mouths
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:51:00, Kania, Difficult to hammer these into their heads
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:53:00, Vedant , Agreed!

2020-03-13,1900-01-01 14:58:00, Kania, Better give it a hospital staffs

2020-03-13,1900-01-01 15:07:00,Dharun, You can never go wrong
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 15:26:00, Roberta, That's why I rather pepper spray
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 15:36:00, Vedant , Hahaha

2020-03-13,1900-01-01 20:14:00, Roberta, The way that Langara have been dealing with this whole situation is so freaking irresponsible
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 20:15:00, Cici, True
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 20:15:00, Cici, At the time they discover the first case
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 20:15:00, Cici, It will be too late
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 20:18:00, Aditi, No offense.. she has a good dressing sense period.

2020-03-13,1900-01-01 20:33:00,Dharun, we only have 2 courses that consider our attendance right? EXPE and WMDD and EXPE is already dunzo. Will missing WMDD now reduce our percentage?
2020-03-13,1900-01-01 20:35:00, Jasman, Yes it will unless you have valid reason

2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:16:00, Kirra, That announcement is so vague
2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:18:00, Kania, hahah on mar 16 and 17 but will continue for the term. can they just not say starting mar 16
2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:20:00, Roberta, The announcement is poorly written
2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:20:00, Roberta, But I think that they start to go online from 16
2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:25:00, Kirra, So what happens tomorrow?
2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:25:00, Kirra, No class?

2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:31:00, Vedant , Might have to present online on a team call or something
2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:32:00, Kania, 😓
2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:33:00, Edward, zoom！
2020-03-15,1900-01-01 14:33:00, Vedant , Don’t give her any ideas lol

2020-03-16,1900-01-01 19:16:00,Vasu, laughing is different in portuguese?
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 19:18:00, Arsh , yes like its diff in punjabi @16047219059 ''ÇP'' bro
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 19:18:00, Roberta, But don't care about me
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:00:00, Cici, Any one got same result for chunks and whole df in task 5?
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:01:00, Vedant , Not supposed to be the same
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:01:00, Cici, What about task6?
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:01:00, Vedant , Working on it
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:03:00, Cici, I got different result again in task 6🤦🏻‍♀️
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:03:00, Cici, I know...
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:03:00, Cici, Why we have to create list first🤦🏻‍♀️
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:03:00, Vedant , I don’t get this guy. So weird.
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:04:00, Cici, Maybe he just want to test you how to create list and then append it
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:07:00, Vedant , Bring it on lol
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:20:00, Kirra, Maybe its also spposed to be diffeent?
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:20:00, Kirra, For task 6?
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 21:22:00, Vedant , Don’t know yet
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:40:00,Dharun, You have to get different results for Df and the chucks
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:40:00,Dharun, For both task 5 & 6 it has to be different.
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:40:00,Dharun, And his following questions does not ask if they are the same..
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:41:00,Dharun, They ask if you agree with what you see and how to avoid the difference.
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:42:00,Dharun, breaking the data into chunks to read in the data is a good method to import data. But using the dataset as chunks is bound to give faulty answers.
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:43:00,Dharun, This is what I know. And I think this makes sense.

2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:44:00,Dharun, Which means this 1 mark is 0.006%>
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:44:00,Dharun, !*
2020-03-16,1900-01-01 22:45:00,Dharun, So I am done trying to understand his Christopher Nolan genre questions.

2020-03-17,1900-01-01 12:58:00, David, I think 4 is easier
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 12:59:00, Vedant , You create one presentation and record voiceovers for your part. Then merge all the voiceovers and align it with your presentation. Too much work.

2020-03-17,1900-01-01 16:55:00, Roberta, The school year was cancelled for children

2020-03-17,1900-01-01 16:56:00, David, 😂
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 16:57:00, David, The news are so distracting
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 16:57:00,Dharun, I am in denial.
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 16:57:00, Roberta, Guys really the situation is difficult
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 16:57:00,Dharun, My only source of information for now is this group.

2020-03-17,1900-01-01 16:59:00,Dharun, Now I'm not the only one who is poor
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Roberta, Is a matter of time
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:00:00, Roberta, I lost some money in Br
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:00:00, David, Trump wants to inject 1 trillion dollar in the economy. That is humongous to save it. They're desperate
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:00:00,Dharun, Oh...
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:00:00, Roberta, Because Ibov is melting down
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:00:00,Dharun, That sounds bad

2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:01:00,Dharun, Omg .. you guys are making me panic ..
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:01:00, Roberta, Also small companies will suffer
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:01:00, Roberta, Because they can't be open
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:01:00,Dharun, We should all join toilet paper company's
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:01:00, Roberta, I'm living this panic since Thursday
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:01:00,Dharun, Companies*

2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Kirra, Canada will decrease permanent residency visas in the next few years because of recession
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, I think they should at least pause for two weeks
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, Maybe other way
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:02:00, David, Oh my gosh. And we're just starting. Restaurants have had less than 50% in customers for 2 weeks in anrow and more business are closing causing no cashflow.
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, They increase
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Jasman, Yeahh
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:03:00, Roberta, They rely on immigrants to pay taxes
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:03:00, Roberta, The whole canadian pension system need of immigrants
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:03:00, Jasman, Their economy has increased just because of immigrants/ international students
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:04:00,Dharun, Wow... I feel dumb ..
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:04:00, Amir, we should ask langara to put our tuition into instalments to be paid in the future
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:04:00, Roberta, Also we have to account that these kind of diseases could create a panic fear worldwide
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:05:00, Roberta, That will reduce immigration moviment

2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:05:00, Roberta, Because we can see that anti globalization agenda is  based on closed markets and less immigration
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:06:00, Kirra, Now is the best time to buy stocks though 🤣
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:06:00, Roberta, Maybe the corona will give more strength to this political setup
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:06:00, Roberta, Or on the other hand people can ask for more social protection and bigger welfare state
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:07:00, Roberta, And the world move for social democracy
2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:07:00, Roberta, I think we will now after us election

2020-03-17,1900-01-01 17:46:00,Dharun, So will our fees be cheaper?

2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:04:00, Roberta, Dana midterm2 still going to be monday?
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:14:00, Jaspreet, in last question DANA assignment we need to remove two outlier or one
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:17:00, Kania, i removed 2
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:17:00, Jaspreet, ok
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:24:00, Roberta, I removed one
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:30:00, Jaspreet, so in both cases we are rejecting null hypothesis
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:30:00, Jaspreet, means I am rejecting null in both
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:32:00, Roberta, With outlier reject
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:32:00, Roberta, Without outlier fail to reject
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:33:00, Jaspreet, but if we remove both outlier
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:33:00, Jaspreet, rejects null in both cases
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:33:00, Roberta, Have to check but I don't think so
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:36:00, Kirra, Only 31
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:36:00, Kirra, Is outlier
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:36:00, Kirra, @12363340235
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:36:00, Kirra, I think lol
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:37:00, Jaspreet, box plot there are two right
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:37:00, Roberta, I just excluded 31
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:41:00, Kirra, <Media omitted>
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:41:00, Kirra, they didnt consider -13 to be a significant outlier
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:41:00, Roberta, <Media omitted>
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:42:00, Kirra, really?
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:42:00, Kirra, so -13 is also an outlier?
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:42:00, Roberta, <Media omitted>
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:43:00, Roberta, So @17788855554  @12363340235  giving the nature of the question I think It does make difference the outlier and you should remove only 31
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:44:00, Roberta, Doesn't make any sense reject in both answers
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:44:00, Kania, Oh I just based it on boxplot
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Kania, I alr submitted it so 🤷
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 14:46:00, Jaspreet, hmm
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 15:08:00, Roberta, should be reject with outlier
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 15:08:00, Roberta, fail to without
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 15:08:00, Roberta, @kania if you feel so you can overwrite your subscription
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 16:15:00, Jaspreet, are we expecting a lab today also

2020-03-18,1900-01-01 19:22:00, Tuli , When is the cpsc project due?

2020-03-18,1900-01-01 20:22:00,Dharun, Anytime?
2020-03-18,1900-01-01 20:22:00, Roberta, That pic is from a friend  who collected hers today

2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:39:00, Roberta, A but there's not enough evidence
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:40:00, Kirra, 🤣
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:41:00, David, There's almost not enough evidence for anything right now. This thing is getting worse by the minute and people are trying to figure it out.
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:41:00, Kania, I'm just reading articles and I'm alr mentally drained.. can't imagine those on the front line working nonstop to fight the virus 😭
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:42:00, Vedant , Wait till it spreads in India. I highly doubt the government would be able to control it or rather do anything at all.
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:42:00, Kirra, ^ especially with that population density
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:42:00, Vedant , Exactly.
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:42:00, Kania, Did India close their borders?
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:43:00, Vedant , They did
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:43:00, Kirra, Is it crazy we have 8 deaths altogether in Canada... and 7 of it is in BC
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:44:00, Kania, Because they keep telling ppl to self isolate
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:44:00, Vedant , BC has older people with lower immunities. That has an effect.
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:45:00, Kania, It's not going to work~ the virus spreads thru the vents etc. That's why they installed negative air pressure rooms for outbreaks.. idk what the govt are thinking
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:46:00, Kania, Yeah but will the person really stay at home?
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:46:00, Kania, Who can guarantee? Who's gonna get food for them?
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:47:00, Vedant , That’s the whole point. What about people who don’t have a home!
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:47:00, David, It actually can stay in the air for a  while
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:48:00, Kania, Yeap. Hk suspected that too when the whole apartment was infected after one person was tested positive. Then again it could be them touching contaminated surfaces
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:49:00, David, Nations have no other option than to keep their people in as much isolation and closing people businesses
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:49:00, Vedant , Just stay safe and isolated guys. Go to work only if it doesn’t involve contact with people and take all precautions.
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:50:00, Kania, Yeap 😭
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:50:00, David, We're headed into a global recession. Never a dull moment for us.
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:51:00, David, I'm already tired of staying home haha and it's been only a few days... Haha
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:51:00, Kania, I love it!!
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:52:00, Kania, 😂
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:52:00, David, So much speculation going around. Very dangerous
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:52:00, Kania, But I'd much prefer to be in Singapore right now..
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:52:00, David, Haha so much for coming back on time after spring break
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:52:00, David, Haha and gold
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:54:00, Kania, Hahah
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:54:00, Kania, Everything is so cheap now!
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:54:00, Kirra, Buy your stocks when it hits rock bttm
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:54:00, Kania, But it will keep going down
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:55:00, David, Yes. Plan to retire early hahaha
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:55:00, Kania, Until a vaccine is developed...
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:56:00, Kania, I thought we at the point worst than the IMF 2008?
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:56:00, David, Oh Vedant. At this point is inevitable. The Rock has just hit the water . Wait for the waves
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:56:00, Kania, Financial crisis I mean
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:57:00, David, So bad. The plunge is as bad if not even worse (and it's not over yet) AND so much more debt everywhere AND dozens of industries are being mutilated right now
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:58:00, David, All at the same time
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:58:00, David, Which was not the case in 2008
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:58:00, Vedant , Netflix and Zoom Meetings will surely make tons of money
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:58:00, David, And toilet paper companies haha
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 00:59:00, Kirra, Like i said recession is bad news for international students
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:00:00, Kirra, Recession = Less Jobs = Less permanent residency visas

2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:05:00, Vedant , Hahah agreed
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:05:00, David, I think you guys will have an edge when applying because of your skills
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:06:00, Vedant , New Job Role = Covid-19 Analyst
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:06:00, Kirra, We can form a regression model
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:07:00, David, 😂
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:08:00, Kirra, Use median age as predictor
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:08:00, Kirra, As well as percentage of people with blood type A
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:09:00, David, Probably the data will satisfy all assumptions haha
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:10:00, Roberta, Brazil is insanely growing
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:11:00, David, They are already having a hard time. This is the last thing they need
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:12:00, Roberta, Yes the economy is collapsing
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:13:00, Roberta, With the covid-19 a lot will suffer
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:13:00, Roberta, I'm having a tough time to stay focused and doing our activities
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:13:00, Roberta, Like college activities
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:14:00, Roberta, Because I'm way too conected and I've been reading all the corona news
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:14:00, Roberta, Sometimes I feel kinda panicking
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:14:00, Kirra, <Media omitted>
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:14:00, Roberta, Then I chill a little then panic  again
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:16:00, David, Definately an unprecedented challenge for many students all across the country
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:16:00, David, And meanwhile the Canadian money is plummeting 😓😓😓

2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:17:00, Kirra, Every currency is plummeting right now except USD... even euro is going down
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:18:00, Roberta, When facing global fear everyone look for stability  this means US dollars and Us treasure notes
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:19:00, David, Can you send us an updated one ? Haha
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:19:00, Kirra, Ill find some
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:19:00, Kirra, Extrapolations
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:20:00, David, Haha just very interesting to see the comparison
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:22:00, David, Another worrisome thing is the crime. Crisis time = desperation = crime where there's a lot of corruption

2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:27:00, Roberta, Vatican is in Italy  🙃 I don't want to live there
2020-03-19,1900-01-01 01:27:00, Roberta, All the other except Vatican are poor countries so probably they are not testing

2020-03-20,1900-01-01 23:17:00, Kania, But they claimed that countries were not doing anything despite their warning

2020-03-21,1900-01-01 16:38:00, Jaspreet, so the cut off score is not 90 %
2020-03-21,1900-01-01 16:44:00, Vedant , This could be wrong. I’ll have to recheck.
2020-03-21,1900-01-01 16:44:00, Jaspreet, book also says the same
2020-03-21,1900-01-01 16:45:00, Vedant , I think the cut off might be 0.75

2020-03-24,1900-01-01 22:00:00, Amir, and chaos will ensue
2020-03-24,1900-01-01 22:00:00, Amir, and people themselves will suffer

2020-03-27,1900-01-01 10:42:00,Rashman, Is someone did this ??

2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:18:00, Tuli , good to know :P
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:19:00, Jasman, For Canadians😂
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:19:00, Kirra, You have to file taxes in 2019 and 2018
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:20:00, Kirra, We werent even here yet in 2018 lol
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:20:00, Jasman, Till now we are not eligible for any of the plan ?
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:20:00, Jasman, Except house rent plan
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:21:00, Kirra, EI if you have 700 hours
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:21:00, Kirra, Otherwise no
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:26:00,Rashman, If this plan would be applicable for students then  I don't think so any Sep intake student take an advantage of it .
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:27:00,Rashman, Because 5k Dollars is huge amount for me😅
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:31:00, Jasman, And there are many😂
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:34:00,Rashman, Then they started in August 😅
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:36:00, Jasman, We are here from 7 months🙄
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:37:00,Rashman, But 5 months are counted from last year
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 18:37:00, Jasman, Ohh okayy
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 22:27:00, Amir, There is no mention of the prior amount of x dollars earned to be eligible.
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 22:27:00, Beth, true
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 22:28:00, Beth, CERB might be exclusive for canadians only
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 22:29:00, Amir, I read it from this page: https://www.cfs-fcee.ca/what-students-need-to-know-about-the-federal-governments-covid-19-economic-response-plan/

2020-03-27,1900-01-01 22:31:00, Beth, good to hear... I hope so..
2020-03-27,1900-01-01 22:31:00, Amir, the second one actually does mention the 5000 dollars

2020-03-28,1900-01-01 23:10:00, Naval, @989126082632 - We need to discuss🙈🙈
2020-03-28,1900-01-01 23:13:00, Amir, he meant one person for the whole class. I would be happy to delegate the class and convey everyone’s choice of option 1 to him.
2020-03-28,1900-01-01 23:15:00, Naval, Option 2 please🙏🙏🙏
2020-03-28,1900-01-01 23:18:00, Roberta, 🤣🤣🤣🤣

2020-03-30,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Vedant , It’s like she wrote this email while almost in tears 😂
2020-03-30,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Kirra, I estimate that 80% of the class cheated
2020-03-30,1900-01-01 17:21:00, Naval, If the class is allowed to give exams🙊🙊
2020-03-30,1900-01-01 17:23:00, Roberta, She could easily avoid this by call it of the semester with project and assignments instead of that midterm.
2020-03-30,1900-01-01 17:23:00, Roberta, In fact all of the instructors should change for assignments this kinda of online exam in word will never work
2020-03-30,1900-01-01 17:24:00, Roberta, They will need to find a better way to do this

2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:30:00, Vedant , I do!

2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:44:00, Jaspreet, we should only use the tables provided by her
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:45:00, Jaspreet, also remember to submit pdf + word document
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:49:00, Kirra, Yeah a lot of people used online calculator for the last midterm instead of tables from her
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:53:00, Edward, <Media omitted>
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:53:00, Kirra, But in her solution on d2l
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:53:00, Kirra, Its the same number as online calculator
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:55:00, Kirra, Kinda inconsistent
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:55:00, Kirra, <Media omitted>
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:55:00, Kirra, 2.17 is not in our f table
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:56:00, Kirra, Its between 2.11 and 2.17
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:56:00, Amir, you’re talking about what’s allowed and what’s not as if you’re gonna abide by it.

2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:56:00, Kirra, Yeah but that is for df 24
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:57:00, Kirra, The df is 25 and 28
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:57:00, Edward, there is a similar symbol
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Edward, approximate
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Kirra, Yeah i guess but in class she said to give the range so i assumed it was between df 24 and 30
2020-03-31,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Edward, i think it is fine to use range or approximation in this question

2020-04-02,1900-01-01 18:26:00, Manoj, not yet
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 18:26:00, Manoj, but i was thinking to mail them
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 18:48:00,Vasu, Jaspreet did...they said no
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 18:57:00, Arsh , it has to be a convincing one
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Arsh , PDD-DA 19

2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:08:00, Kirra, how much waiver r u expecting?
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:10:00, Arsh , <Media omitted>
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:11:00, Arsh , its 8k this term
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:11:00, Tuli , Yea
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:12:00, Kirra, 5k discount
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:12:00, Beth, more than half is not reasonable
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:13:00, Kirra, 5k multiply by 28 is 140k
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:13:00, Kirra, we are not the only international students in this college
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:13:00, Jasman, Your expectations are too high!😂
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:13:00, Arsh , They received 140k 
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:14:00, Kirra, 140k is for all international students in Langara?
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:15:00, Arsh , yeah
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:15:00, Jasman, 😠
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:15:00, Prerna, They're anyway going to save so much of infrastructural costs this semester
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:15:00, Kirra, so there is 6300 international students in langara
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:16:00, Kirra, 140k divided by 6300
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:16:00, Arsh , thts why i said a decent 3k off
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:16:00, Kirra, each student will get 22 dollars
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:16:00, Kirra, discount
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:16:00, Prerna, 😅😅
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:16:00, Kirra, yeahhh
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:16:00, Kirra, exactly
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:16:00, Kirra, 140k is peanuts
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:17:00, Prerna, It's not like they've got only the specified amount of funds.

2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:19:00,Vasu, If we all unite may be they has to wave off some fees
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:19:00,Vasu, If we all dont pay what they ask
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:21:00, Beth, agree...

2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:22:00, Jaspreet, is very small sample set
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:22:00, Jaspreet, Michael said it is the IE department who needs to fix this fees thing
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:24:00, Aditi, Let's give a try.. anyway we have to pay the exact amount but a little try won't hurt..
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:24:00, Arsh , Still 18 days to go

2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:56:00, Arsh , Once it is declined 
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:56:00, Aditi, We can give this option if they deny
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:56:00, Aditi, Yeah exactly
2020-04-02,1900-01-01 19:56:00, Amir, clever

2020-04-03,1900-01-01 14:35:00, Amir, what's NG grading?
2020-04-03,1900-01-01 14:36:00, Roberta, No Grade = NG
2020-04-03,1900-01-01 14:36:00, Roberta, basically if you fail a course
2020-04-03,1900-01-01 14:36:00, Roberta, hey well put NG instead of your actual grade
2020-04-03,1900-01-01 14:36:00, Roberta, then your GPA is not affected
2020-04-03,1900-01-01 14:38:00, Amir, then what happens the courses for which your failed course was a prerequisite for? can one still take them next term?
2020-04-03,1900-01-01 14:38:00, Roberta, no

2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:21:00, Jaspreet, yes yes
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:24:00, Cici, i mean how can she tell if we are using the internet or not?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:25:00, Cici, We are supposed to do everything on laptop
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:25:00, Tuli , useless
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:25:00, Kirra, Exactly
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:25:00, Kirra, Lol
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:26:00, Roberta, How she will know if we are using internet
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:26:00, Roberta, This doesn't make any sense
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:26:00, Kirra, I mean if she decides that we do screensharing instead of
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:26:00, Kirra, Camera
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Cici, also how she will know if we are talking to each other?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Kirra, Some people have 2 laptops
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Kirra, Haha
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Navjot , 😂😂
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Cici, you are typing too much words?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Roberta, The sad part is that I'll need to change I can't stay on camera in my pjs
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Navjot , Exactly
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:27:00, Cici, I don't think so
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:28:00, Kirra, Nope
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:28:00, Cici, also we have to look at each other's face through the whole exam
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:28:00, Cici, it will make me laugh
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:29:00, Roberta, Actually don't because I'll stay looking to my word
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:29:00, Roberta, And let the zoom minimized
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:29:00, Cici, a lot of instructor did this
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:30:00, Cici, i guess she just want you to know that she is watching you
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:30:00,Rashman, Some people have internet issues too 🙄🙄
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:30:00, Vedant , She can piss off.
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:31:00, Amir, The big brother is watching you comrade
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:33:00, Amir, She put so much unwanted stress on me this term and she continues to do so up until this very last moment. Just can’t take it anymore.
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:33:00, Tuli , yeah
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:34:00, Harshad, <Media omitted>
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:35:00, Cici, Highly agree
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:39:00, Kirra, What if ur laptop doesnt have a camera haha 🤣
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:39:00, Tuli , exactly
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:39:00, Tuli , hahah
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:48:00, Arsh , zoom runs in same browser
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:49:00, Kirra, ?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:49:00, Aditi, 😣
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:50:00, Arsh , i mean if anybody googles
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:50:00, Kirra, But i use the zoom app
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:50:00, Arsh , i am assuming this 🤔
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:50:00, Jasman, Yeah
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:50:00, Harshad, 😂😂
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:50:00, Kirra, Not browser based
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:50:00, Harshad, We reject your hypothesis
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:51:00, Kirra, And conclude that zoom does not share cookies with emmap
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:51:00, Arsh , even through app it launches in browser no?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:51:00, Harshad, No
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:51:00, Kirra, Well she gave link
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:51:00, Cici, she is going to check our cookies?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:52:00, Arsh , she is insane
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:52:00, Arsh , she ll go to any extent
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:52:00, Vedant , She can’t do it without written consent. That’s the law.
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:53:00, Kirra, We can sue langara if that happens
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:53:00, Kirra, Make some dollars
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:53:00, Aditi, 🤣🤣
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:53:00, Vedant , Dollars X 2
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:54:00, Vedant , Nope. Runs in the background.
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:54:00, Kirra, I am wondering if she meant d2l lock
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:54:00, Vedant , Otherwise how do plan to work on your exam
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:54:00, Arsh , woth camera on
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:54:00, Vedant , *do you
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:54:00, Vedant , Yes
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:55:00, Cici, she wants us to mute our self
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:55:00, Cici, even we are talking
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:55:00, Kirra, Wait she said cant use the internet
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:55:00, Cici, she can't hear us
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:55:00, Harshad, We can wear a mask 😂
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:55:00, Kirra, Means we can turnoff our wifi
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:56:00, Vedant , Hahaha
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:57:00, Cici, then zoom will only show your profile photo to her
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:57:00, Roberta, The only thing that intrigued me is that she said before open book and now no internet
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:58:00, Roberta, I'll just open zoom on firefox and my exam I can google it stuff on google chrome
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Kirra, But she said no internet.. using zoom is technically using the internet we can argue with her that way...
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Roberta, Then I skip the cookies problem
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Kirra, Is there really a cookies issue
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Roberta, But I don't think she's really check this
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 21:59:00, Roberta, And even if this is possible shareable with her
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:00:00, Roberta, Because there's privacy issues regarding this right?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:00:00, Kirra, Imma try and click on the link now
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:02:00, Tuli , it seems like usual meeting
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:02:00, Kirra, Yeah its like a normal meetinng
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:03:00, Jasman, What if she asks us to share screen
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:03:00, Tuli , only one can do at a time
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:03:00, Jasman, No
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:03:00, Jasman, Multiple participants can share at the same time
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:03:00, Tuli , and i dont think she wants class to see answers
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:04:00, Jasman, <Media omitted>
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:04:00, Kirra, Then we can use 2 laptops
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:04:00, Kirra, 1 laptop will be the screen share and the other laptop will be the non screen share one... where we can google
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:05:00, Roberta, But she will see you moving from one laptop to another
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:05:00, Roberta, I kust think that you guys are overthinking this
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:06:00, Amir, run separate zoom with the person you want to cheat with and silently share screens
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:06:00, Kirra, If we screenshare she can only see the screenshare not camera
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:07:00, Jasman, Can a person share screen and camera simultaneously on zoom?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:07:00, Kirra, Not sure about this if someone has experience lmk
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:07:00, Kirra, I dont think so though
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Roberta, She'll not ask you to screenshare
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Tuli , if we share the screen ppl can see their paper
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Tuli , its not practical
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Jasman, 😂😂😂
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Roberta, The thing that bothered her is that people communicate
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Roberta, She will watching in zoom
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Kirra, 🤣
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Jasman, Only Emma can see
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Kirra, I forgot about this
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:08:00, Roberta, Just to make sure that you're not talking to anyone
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:09:00, Kirra, You can also creats a video loop of urself
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:09:00, Kirra, Create*
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:10:00, Kirra, So she thinks its u lol but its just a video loop haha
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:10:00, Tuli , hahahah
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:10:00, Roberta, Study will be lesser work than create a loop video
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:10:00, Kirra, 👆
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:10:00, Kirra, True that
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:11:00, Navjot , If we will share our screens then we are able to see everyone's answer right?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:11:00, Navjot , Because we will work in word
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:11:00, Amir, what’s the overall minimum grade to pass?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:11:00, Tuli , 60

2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:12:00, Kirra, 50% for finals
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:23:00, Cici, What does 50% for final means
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:23:00, Cici, You have to reach 50% in finals then you are eligible to pass?
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:24:00, Amir, supposedly
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:24:00, Kirra, <Media omitted>
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:26:00, Cici, Hahahahahahah
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:33:00, Roberta, Yes
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:34:00, Roberta, But I have a friend who passed in financial accounting without getting 50% in the final
2020-04-04,1900-01-01 22:34:00, Roberta, So I never now if this rule is actually true

2020-04-07,1900-01-01 14:01:00, Naval, It is difficult to get all content in 15-20 slides
2020-04-07,1900-01-01 14:02:00, Roberta, I think he said that you can use pdf of the notebook too
2020-04-07,1900-01-01 14:03:00, Naval, Even that would be too long right???
2020-04-07,1900-01-01 14:03:00, Naval, Is there no limit???

2020-04-16,1900-01-01 23:33:00, Roberta, Hahaha more accurate would be drink  vodka and forget the last 24h
2020-04-16,1900-01-01 23:33:00, Roberta, At least in my case
2020-04-16,1900-01-01 23:45:00,Dharun, Vodka!!!!!✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼

2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:15:00, Roberta, Did everyone registered in Business?
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:15:00, Jasman, No
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:15:00, Roberta, Because for me there was an error
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:15:00, Jasman, Yeah same
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:16:00, Jasman, Only Naval was able to register I think
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:17:00, Roberta, Tks Jasman
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:17:00, Amir, me neither
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:18:00,Rashman, I thinking nobody registered except Naval
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:18:00, Naval, Still you guys are unable to register???
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:19:00, Jasman, I already did
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 00:36:00, Nicky, No I haven't registered :))))
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 07:10:00,Dharun, So we all just mailed him?
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 07:11:00,Dharun, Did he extend the time later last night?
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 08:54:00, Roberta, Don't know
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 08:54:00, Roberta, He replied ?
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:27:00, Amir," ""U-Pass BC program suspended as of May 1"""
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:29:00, Harshad, 😂
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:30:00, Roberta, I was thinking
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:30:00, Roberta, Khurram played us
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:31:00, Roberta, He behave all term as Mr. Nice Guy
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:31:00, Roberta, And at the very end that final exam
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:31:00, Roberta, Damn
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:32:00, Nikita , True
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:33:00, Amir, The problem with this exam was its dependency on q1 which required a bit of experience with data structure
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:33:00, Kirra, Michael gave him a lecture on how to be mean to us because of the emma incident haha
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:35:00, Roberta, The other questions I agree
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:35:00, Roberta, But question one
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:35:00, Roberta, Was a freaking nightmare
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:35:00, Amir, now most of us got stuck in q1 and panicked which influenced the whole thing
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:35:00, Amir, and we could not simply move on from q1
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:36:00, Roberta, And if you don't get question one right you don't have the df_detail that is needed to do the other questions properly
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:37:00, Naval, Also the memory issue
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:38:00, Amir, did anybody else encounter the memory issue?
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:38:00, Naval, 8gb Ram was unable to handle so many files/df
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:40:00, Roberta, All the time I had that hourglass on the top
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:42:00,Vasu, In my case some of my command never runs nor give a error
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:42:00,Vasu, Lets hope he consider our emails
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:42:00, Roberta, Guys and business?
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:42:00, Roberta, Still unable to register
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:43:00, Roberta, How will I know how much to pay?
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:45:00, Kirra, Add 1700 CAD to whatever u have to pay now
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:45:00,Vasu, Its (565*3)=1695
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:45:00, Roberta, Michael didn't solve this yet
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:46:00, Roberta, Sometimes I ask myself what the heck he does
2020-04-17,1900-01-01 09:48:00, Amir, similar frame of thoughts here 😄😄😄

2020-04-17,1900-01-01 20:32:00, Kiran, Ohhhh my God he is deadly

2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:03:00, Roberta, But ignoring us
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:12:00,Dharun, Dude.. I don't wanna fail
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:12:00,Dharun, Why can't he just acknowledge the mails
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:12:00, Roberta, I just want he accept my exam
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:13:00, Roberta, Just this nothing else
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:15:00, Aditi, He never replies to mails
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:16:00, Aditi, I messaged him once regarding project submission.. he didn't reply to that even but cleared my doubt in announcement only..
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:18:00,Rashman, True
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 12:21:00,Rashman, Its really strange that why he didn't reply our emails
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 14:51:00,Vasu, It means I failed
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 14:57:00, Roberta, Don't jump to conclusions
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 14:58:00,Vasu, But he must reply to atleast one mail
2020-04-18,1900-01-01 14:59:00,Rashman, Me too

2020-04-18,1900-01-01 16:15:00, Naval, Forget about Final exams
2020-04-20,1900-01-01 10:37:00, Amir, Canada’s oil price just turned negative. They now pay you to take their oil. Anyone has any extra bucket I could borrow?
2020-04-20,1900-01-01 11:05:00,Dharun, Should we mail Michael regarding the CPSC exam?
2020-04-20,1900-01-01 11:05:00, Roberta, Happy birthday Kiran !

2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:12:00, Roberta, It supposed to be
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:12:00, Roberta, But I've never learn about someone failing because this rule
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:12:00, Kirra, Dont worry about it
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:12:00, Roberta, And he said that he improved the grades
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:12:00, Kirra, He only cares about overall
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:13:00, Naval, I hope so
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:14:00, Kirra, As long as ur overall grade is 55% u will pass
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:34:00, Nicky, Anyone has Khurram phone number? I need to call him as he added wrong grades for me
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:40:00, Kania, Same... You guys might wanna double check his calculation
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:41:00, Kirra, Which one?
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:41:00, Kirra, Did he particularly miscalculate?
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:41:00, Kania, CPSC overall
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:41:00, Kania, Idk if it's rounding error?
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:43:00, Kirra, He hasnt done overall grade?
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:43:00, Kirra, Yet
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:43:00, Nicky, I mean final exam grade
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:43:00, Kania, Oh right.. I mixed up overall grade and final grade 🙊
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:43:00, Kania, Sorry for confusion
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:44:00, Kirra, Dont look at the letter grade he put in the right side
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:45:00, Kirra, Just look at the points
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:45:00, Nicky, Yes I did
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:46:00, Nicky, I mean I received B+ 24/35 but as what he wrote in his annoucement I should have A- 27/35. So I think it is typing mistake
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:47:00, Kirra, ohh A- is supposed to be the overall grade
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:47:00, Kirra, ^^^ he is talking about overall grade in this one
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:48:00, Kirra, so he will bump you up from A- to A
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:48:00, Nicky, Uhm yes it makes sense
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:49:00, Vedant , The grades are calculated by the system. Khurram only puts in the scores. Just make sure your scores and totals are correct.
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:51:00, Vedant , He most likely won’t. I think that marks increase offer was only for those who got a lesser grade than C. But I hope I’m wrong.
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:53:00,Vasu, Do Khurram update overall grade?
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:53:00, Nicky, Yes I think I misunderstand between overall score and final score
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:53:00, Kirra, he said he will add for everyone
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 19:53:00, Kirra, no but u can calculate your score
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 21:22:00,Vasu, Do you get chance to call khurram?
2020-04-21,1900-01-01 23:23:00, Nicky, No I dont have his number
2020-04-22,1900-01-01 00:14:00, Kirra, He added 3% to everyone
2020-04-22,1900-01-01 00:15:00, Kirra, Calculate ur total now
2020-04-22,1900-01-01 01:26:00, Jaspreet, :) yup now looks good

2020-05-12,1900-01-01 14:35:00, Amir, if i understand it correctly
2020-05-12,1900-01-01 14:37:00, Amir, i’d rather search for a job without paying Langara
2020-05-12,1900-01-01 14:39:00, Jasman, Yeah

2020-05-12,1900-01-01 15:03:00, Kirra, you dont have to do co-op... you can go directly to the 3 year PGWP if u want
2020-05-12,1900-01-01 15:03:00, Tuli , yp
2020-05-12,1900-01-01 15:16:00, Roberta, If we decided do co-op when it should be?
2020-05-12,1900-01-01 15:16:00, Tuli , co op duration = study permit duration
2020-05-12,1900-01-01 15:23:00, Amir, do we need to do/apply anything at this moment?
2020-05-12,1900-01-01 15:39:00, Nikita , If you are planning to go for work term..

2020-05-19,1900-01-01 14:59:00, Roberta, They're so delusional
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 14:59:00, Roberta, Usually we going to be rejected to all the job positions that we applied
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:00:00, Roberta, Because we don't have freaking experience
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:00:00, Arsh , This message was deleted
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:00:00, Roberta, And  the co-op should solve this issue
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:00:00, Amir, There are entry level jobs Roberta
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:01:00, Amir, don’t worry
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:01:00, Roberta, All the entry level jobs that I've found ask for 1 or 2 y of experience
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:06:00, Cici, Especially for data analyst
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:07:00, Roberta, Am I crazy? All the indeed job postings for junior level ask for 1 or 2 y of experience.
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:08:00, Roberta, And not always we can transfer personal projects as experience
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:08:00, Roberta, Sometimes they want experience working

2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:19:00, Edward, week 3 - reading resource
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:19:00, Edward, 🤔
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:19:00,Dharun, true that
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:20:00,Rashman, 😅
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:21:00, Jasman, The duration of pgwp will be the same with or without work term?
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:26:00,Dharun, I had the same question @919781706053​.
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:27:00, Tuli , i asked that from IE
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:27:00, Tuli , they said work term is considered as a part of ur course
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:29:00, Kirra, So its better to go direct PGWP
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:30:00, Tuli , yes
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:31:00, Jasman, Yes and I don’t think there is any point to do work term if the duration of pgwp will be the same
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:31:00, Jasman, Why to pay langara for finding a job ourselves
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:39:00, Jasman, Yeah it’s more work
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:39:00, Jasman, And we have to pay for it😂
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:40:00, Roberta, if there's n difference on pgwp
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:40:00, Roberta, does not make sense to pay
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 15:40:00, Jasman, And it will just delay our graduation
2020-05-19,1900-01-01 16:28:00, Kirra, Link?

2020-05-24,1900-01-01 01:17:00,Vasu, make other zero
2020-05-24,1900-01-01 01:20:00, Nicky, Anyone have this error '  missing values are not allowed in subscripted assignments of data frames'
2020-05-24,1900-01-01 01:20:00,Dharun, Yes

2020-05-24,1900-01-01 01:20:00,Dharun, ?

2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:42:00,Vasu, I heard she said she will pass us all
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:42:00, Arsh , she said next class not next week
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:42:00, Roberta, If she said today I doubt that she'll change
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:42:00, Roberta, Yes

2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:43:00, Roberta, If you have any problem you're screwed
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:43:00, Roberta, She could do as a Lab
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:44:00, Roberta, Like Khurram
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:44:00, Roberta, At least we would've til midnight
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:44:00, Nikita , Lets ask her to postpone it to next week
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:44:00, Roberta, No let's play the crazy card
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:44:00, Nikita , Haha

2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Roberta, She'll never do what  we want
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Jasman, Yess
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Nikita , I dont think she will fall for this obe
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Nikita , One&
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Nikita , One*
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Roberta, We have to let her think that she decided
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Jasman, But she said next week🙄
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Nikita , Ok lets try
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00, Nikita , I also think she said next week

2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:45:00,Dharun, Is the*
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:46:00, Arsh , 16
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:46:00, Roberta, I'm 91% sure that she said today
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:46:00, Kiran, Hi guys anyone experienced python shell programmer here
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:46:00, Kirra, yes
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:49:00, David, Yes it's today

2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:51:00, Kirra, Same
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:51:00, Kania, I guess safer to study now then... 😓
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:52:00, Roberta, Yes
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 14:53:00, Roberta, I knew it
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:10:00, Kirra, Can anyone explain this
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:10:00, Kirra, <Media omitted>
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:10:00,Dharun, I can't
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:10:00, Kirra, What do they mean when a loading is flat
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:11:00, Kirra, And why does a flat loading mean that the component on that loading represent the average yield over the maturities
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:12:00, Naval, From where u r studying???🤯
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:12:00, Kirra, Interpretations worksheet
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:12:00, Kirra, Week 4
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:14:00,Vasu, She interpret assignment in different way.
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:17:00, Amir, She just woke up with a big yawn
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:27:00, Kirra, https://langara.zoom.us/j/8520763062?pwd=a0w4UkpBeHFPOU1WaFVmUkZ0UUczUT09
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:27:00, Roberta, We ca ask her at least more time to delivery
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:27:00, Roberta, Like only the class time could be difficult
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:27:00,Vasu, yes
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:32:00, Cici, What the fk?
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:32:00, Cici, Mock test?
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:32:00,Dharun, Hahahaha
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:32:00,Dharun, We are totally screwed
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:32:00, Kania, What did she say? I joined late...
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:32:00,Dharun, She said our assignment 1 was bad
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00, Cici, She said we don’t know what should be submitted
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00,Dharun, So we might have to redo
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00, Roberta, Mock test to show how it supposed to be
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00, Cici, So she is going to give us a mock test and we submit to her
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00, Roberta, Because we did a bad job in assignment 1
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00, Cici, .......
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00, Kania, 😱😭😓
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00, Kania, Thanks y'all!
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:33:00, Cici, I don’t see any logic behind this
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:34:00, Cici, She is not happy with our assignment one
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:34:00, Kiran, Guys make her happy please
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:35:00, Roberta, <Media omitted>
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:35:00, Roberta, My report was made in 30m because I was late truth be told
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:36:00, Nikita , Same🙏🏼
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:37:00,Dharun, Cuz amir is the prophet
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:37:00, Kiran, Amir
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:38:00, Cici, Kania is the key to make her happy
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:38:00, Kania, I don't think I've asked her the right questions tho... 🤔 Where did she get that
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:38:00, Roberta, Kania you're rock
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:38:00,Dharun, You*
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:39:00, Nikita , @17788855554 please ask her to  postpone today's assignment🤣
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:39:00, Roberta, Your nickname should be kaniapedia
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:39:00, Cici, 22 pages omg girl you rock
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:40:00, Amir, mine was 2
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:40:00, Kania, Bcos i gave up on the technical side and decided to do some creative writing 😂
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:40:00, Roberta, Mine 5
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:41:00, Roberta, As I see Kania did a good job in the report is because she's always on time .
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:42:00, Roberta, And we as class are poorly in follow due dates
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:42:00, Kiran, why is she yelling most excited or frustrated
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:42:00, Roberta, So the majority including me   likely did in a hurry
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:44:00, Cici, She is yelling
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:45:00, Amir, I’d do the same 2 page with all the time in the world 😄
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:48:00, Roberta, 🤣
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:53:00, Cici, What is this mock test for?
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:53:00,Dharun, <Media omitted>
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 16:53:00, Cici, PCA?

2020-06-04,1900-01-01 17:29:00, Cici, Based on what she said
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 17:29:00, Cici, We have to clean the dataset first?
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 17:30:00, Kania, So we have to clean and do PCA? Not just PCA ?
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 17:31:00, Nikita , What is meant by screening?
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 17:32:00, Cici, Not sure😭

2020-06-04,1900-01-01 17:51:00, Kiran, we need to do clustering too??
2020-06-04,1900-01-01 17:51:00, Kiran, clustering analysis

2020-06-06,1900-01-01 23:51:00, Roberta, I remember because I was volunteering at carreer week  that day
2020-06-06,1900-01-01 23:52:00, Roberta, We had Expe that day was the last day of the course the follow-up  after the interviews

2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:48:00, Roberta, She was praising me for the previous work I was able to do a decent work before because I had time
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:49:00, Roberta, How I supposed to do this in 55 m
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:49:00, Roberta, It was awfull
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:49:00,Rashman, 😅
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:49:00, Roberta, I literally just copy and paste my outputs
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:50:00, Roberta, First I was working with the freaking anxiety dataset
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:50:00, Roberta, Nothing make sense there
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:52:00, Amir, comforting words but don’t think that cools down Jas’ rage
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:53:00, Roberta, It was refreshing see you all with rage
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:54:00, Roberta, usually I'm the only one in rage
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:54:00, Roberta, 🤣
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:54:00,Vasu, Hahaha

2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:56:00, Cici, One keep giving weird problem and one keep testing something he never taught
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:57:00, Harshad, I was angry too. I don't understand how a professional can to talk to their students like that. Our demands aren't realistic
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:57:00,Vasu, Harshad you put our problem in really nice wording
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:57:00, Roberta, She basically implied that we are all crying babies
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:58:00,Vasu, Why she always deflecting questions to other students.
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Roberta, She was like I don't wanna now your personal problems
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:59:00, Kiran, Asshole
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:59:00, Harshad, Exactly. This is not fair.
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 18:59:00, Harshad, She's the one problem we got.
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:00:00, Tuli , Bitch
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:00:00, Roberta, I was kinda of embarassed that she told me to talk about my work
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:00:00, Roberta, this is awfull
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:00:00, Roberta, puts you in a bad position
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:01:00,Dharun, She can't teach us how to make a report
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:01:00,Dharun, Instead she is making roberta amdt Kania to do what she is getting paid to do
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:01:00,Dharun, And*

2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:04:00, Kania, Noo I actually learned alot from you today Roberta!
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:04:00, Kania, I was just mashing up random shit for the mock quiz.. no flow at all
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:04:00, Kania, @17789032934
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:05:00, Roberta, but Monica is literally making things impossible for us
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:06:00, Roberta, I think she has the idea of giving us a hard time to make us better
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:06:00, Roberta, but you need to be reasonable
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:08:00, Kania, I agree. Asian style.. I always had these teachers in school and somehow we were scared getting humiliated in class so we studied better.. hahaha not sure if that'll work in university
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:10:00, Edward, I always miss variable screening

2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:14:00, Roberta, like sense8
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:17:00, Roberta, Being pragmatic we need to make her give us actual assignments rather this in class stuff
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 19:19:00, Roberta, Because a lot of technical problems could happen
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 21:09:00, Cici, .....nightmare in the past
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 21:22:00, Roberta, Guys quick question

2020-06-09,1900-01-01 21:23:00,Vasu, or you can say NO
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 21:23:00, Arsh , its pointless
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 21:26:00, Edward, 50% for me

2020-06-09,1900-01-01 21:38:00, Amir, you could learn what u learned here a hundredth the price
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 21:39:00, Jasman, How it’s a test drive if we are not eligible to apply for co-op jobs?
2020-06-09,1900-01-01 21:40:00, Arsh , he said u cn apply online

2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Cici, How this one worth 20 points
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Naval, Lol that is not 20 marks
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Cici, 20 points!!!!!!!
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Cici, And I don’t know the answer
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Naval, 4 parts combined 20 marks
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Naval, This individually was not 20 marks
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:58:00, Vedant , Now I think I should've at least read it.
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:59:00, Kirra, How to do this
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:59:00, Cici, Same here.
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 18:59:00, Vedant , It's nothing but the third row of PCA summary.
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:00:00, Kirra, I thought she wanted a screeplot but with cumulative proportion instead of regular proportion
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:01:00, Vedant , She can fuck off.
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:08:00, Vedant , Get used to it now lol
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:18:00, Roberta, This was crazy
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:19:00, Roberta, 😄  I'm laughing because I can relate
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:19:00, David, She told messaged me: I didn't say to clean so don't clean
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:20:00, David, Very thrown off with the whole experience

2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:21:00, Vedant , A+ for everyone 👨🏻‍🎓👩🏻‍🎓
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:21:00, Kiran, Only for Monica
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:22:00, Roberta, What are the implications of the number of oxides that need to be determined by chemical analysis to get a basic idea of the composition of the particular mid-ocean ridge basalt (10 points)?
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:22:00, Naval, Hahahhaaa
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:22:00, Roberta, this was the craziest for me
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:22:00, Roberta, I was like how can I answer this if I don't understand
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:23:00, Naval, Why the hell she is replying privately???
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:23:00, Roberta, she told me when I said that I submitted: now you can relax
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:24:00, Roberta, Hahaha
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:24:00, Roberta, And I was like I'll never relax again
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:27:00, Cici, Trueeeee. That implication of number of oxides really confused me 🤷🏻‍♀️ I read about three times
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:27:00, Kiran, No naval this data belongs to chemical mining project did in 2008
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:28:00, Kiran, Basically this is a publication paper done by phd students with similar questions
2020-06-16,1900-01-01 19:55:00, Kirra, Yes I saw that

2020-06-17,1900-01-01 00:42:00, Kirra, What time did he grade lab 5?

2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:40:00,Vasu, I think Monica is like our future client that we will face.
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:41:00, Harshad, This is an example of mitigating during a project.
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:41:00, Kiran, Exactly we should learn Vietnamese
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:43:00,Dharun, Oooooooooook
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:44:00, Cici, it's not about the questions

2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:46:00, Naval, 🤣🤣

2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:46:00, Vedant , And she still won’t
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:46:00,Vasu, Amir you must give suggestion
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:47:00,Vasu, Thats A SWAG
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:47:00, Arsh , Remember emma used to say ‘I ll put an easy exam next time’ and it was even tougher
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:47:00, Amir, I don't have any points
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:47:00, Cici, hahahahahahahahah

2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:48:00, Cici, Did anyone rmr our first midterm with Emma? She was using the same test paper to next cohort but the questions were much easier =(((
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:49:00, Kirra, lol
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:49:00, Kirra, she knows what happened to the class average last time so she made it easier
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:49:00, Kirra, haha
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:50:00, Roberta, I think every student has points  but is scary to say outloud
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:50:00, Roberta, we think we may suffer retaliation
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:51:00, Roberta, since she's kinda crazy
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:54:00, Roberta, Omg Amir don't make me laugh
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:55:00, Amir, That was serious 😄
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:55:00, Roberta, I would die if you said that to her
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:55:00, Roberta, But at the end my point is we pay her salary
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:55:00, Roberta, She can't do whatever she wants
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:56:00,Vasu, You must watch Dictatorship
2020-06-18,1900-01-01 16:56:00, Arsh , Dictator or dictatorship?

2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:56:00, Kirra, the instructors will read it at least
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:56:00, Roberta, at least let's give him a headache
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:56:00, Amir, and we have already complained like a thousand times to him
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:57:00, Kirra, at least for azadeh i told her to take notes from sharon and emma when writing lecture notes/powerpoint...
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:57:00, Kiran, that asshole pretends to be dumb when comes to feedback anyway
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:57:00, Roberta, complain is a second nature for me
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:57:00,Vasu, REBEL Roberta
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:58:00,Vasu, Great Insight
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Roberta, But if we answer good things only it will look like  everything is fine
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Roberta, I don't even care to be anonymous anymore
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Kirra, THIS
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Roberta, I could say what I wrote on Monica's face
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Naval, I Agree
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Amir, it's anonymous but not that anonymous 😄
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Roberta, I think they always knows
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Harshad, Same.
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Roberta, so I try to be honest without being personal
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Roberta, for Monica I said  that she doesn't provide enough time to activities
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Roberta, I said this on her face
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 16:59:00,Vasu, I described in brief what Monica is doing in class
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:00:00,Vasu, Very brief
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:00:00, Naval, I'll describe in detail😈😈
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:00:00, Roberta, Also I said that her way of doing things creates stress among students
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:00:00,Vasu, True
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:00:00, Kirra, i wrote 5 paragraphs for azadeh and i said that her lecture notes were useless and she should learn from our previous dana instructors...
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:01:00, Naval, 👏👏
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, since she shows favoritism and her expectations are way bigger than what she gives back
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, I told the same
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, her slides are useless my words
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, her grading criteria not clear
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:03:00, Harshad, Agreed
2020-06-22,1900-01-01 17:04:00,Vasu, I mean long ans or short every question has same marks

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:53:00, Tuli , nothing to lose
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:54:00, Roberta, he hire crazy people to be instructors and we have to be happy about it
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:54:00, Jasman, Last sem Emma played

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:54:00, Cici, He just probably doesn't want to admit that he picked wrong instructors
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:54:00, Roberta, definitely
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:54:00,Rashman, Exactly
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:57:00, Amir, That big picture and application explanation comes from my evaluation for her
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Roberta, I think she did this ppt
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:58:00, Roberta, just because we said she plagiarize other peoples work
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Harshad, Hahahaha 😂

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 16:59:00, Amir, I thought that too but quickly doubted myself
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:00:00, Roberta, I googled seems she did the ppt
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:01:00, Vedant , Wow. Unreal.

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:01:00, Kirra, @17788371028 did she say anything about this
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:01:00, Roberta, she actually did the ppt
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:01:00, Kirra, cuz she hasnt finished grading my assignment 2
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, like there's a bunch of things of internet but the conclusions are hers
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Roberta, definitely
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Tuli , No she rarely replies to the point
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Tuli , Now that she said she ll give another
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:02:00, Harshad, Saving the best for last. 😂

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:09:00, Jasman, 😂😂😂
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:09:00, Harshad, Why does she never get his name right?
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:09:00, Tuli , ask agaain

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:09:00, Roberta, Is just Michael's presence
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:10:00, Roberta, she wasn't using R without explain
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:11:00, Roberta, this is my hope
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:11:00, Roberta, that she's trying to do better
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:11:00, Vedant , Ignoring questions is not doing better
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:11:00, Kiran, She won't respond to doubts?
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:12:00, Roberta, Again?
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:12:00, Jaspreet, She has changed 4 examples
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:12:00, Jaspreet, by now
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:12:00, Kiran, Just reading pdf
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:13:00,Vasu, It is better if she teaches then after some time or some slides open the house for question. As during the class she is unable to answer.
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:14:00, Roberta, I was wrong again
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:14:00, Roberta, https://youtu.be/BnMaYR4v-Hk

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:16:00, Amir, There is no way she knows Wally
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:17:00, Amir, the boy in her slides

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:17:00, Kirra, Its better that way
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Roberta, Usually I understand better from  the yt video
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Kiran, 🙂🙂🙂
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Roberta, But she can't say don't use my code
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Roberta, if she uses other people work
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Harshad, Because it's not her code.
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Kirra, Yes exactly haha
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Harshad, 😂😂
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:18:00, Roberta, yep
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:20:00, Aditi, Yeah.  It's better if she just send us the link.. Atleast then we don't have to listen her voice😏
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:21:00, Roberta, 🤣🤣🤣

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:41:00, Kirra, 😒

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:54:00, Kiran, atleast she can change values
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:55:00,Vasu, Bhai why she do that much effort
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:55:00,Dharun, Wow. The amount of work she puts in each lecture is impressive
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:55:00, Jaspreet, <Media omitted>
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:55:00, Jasman, 🤣🤣
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:55:00, Kiran, 😁
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:55:00, Prerna, 😅
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:55:00, Roberta, For me the worst is that she uses the same words as the lady in the video
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:55:00,Dharun, She didn't even bother to make her own presentation
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:56:00, Jaspreet, hmm
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:56:00, Cici, Jaspreet become a different version of Jaspreet everytime he attends Monica's class
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:56:00, Roberta, 🤣🤣

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 17:57:00,Dharun, I don't even think Monica knows that there is a guy called Jaspreet in this class. She always calls him some or the other name

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:01:00, Roberta, But I'm kinda of regretting this choice
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:02:00, Cici, harsh fact but true😅😅
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:02:00, Roberta, If  I took the economics masters I would at least have decent professors
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:02:00, Cici, at least they will wear suits every class with well prepared PowerPoint
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:03:00, Roberta, Yep
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:03:00,Vasu, Point to be noted
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:03:00, Nikita , Did she use an 'eye' in her slides?🤣🤣
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:03:00, Roberta, Yes

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:06:00, Cici, Jas problem always solved by classmates
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:06:00, Amir, This session breaks the most Whatsapp messages sent during a lecture.
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:06:00,Vasu, Thats why he is so curious
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:07:00, Aditi, There's no other reason to date her😏🤣
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:08:00,Vasu, Good Choice bro
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:09:00, Kirra, i think she actually has Canadian PR though so its good you can get dual citizenship
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:09:00,Rashman, 😅😅
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:09:00, Aditi, 🤣 practical talk kirraaa
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:09:00, Jasman, But she wrote Mission Cananda
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:09:00, Jasman, Canada*
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:10:00, Jasman, I don’t think she has
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:10:00, Kirra, yes but probably Langara sponsored her PR already
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:10:00, Kirra, by now
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:10:00, Kiran, What a waste
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:10:00, Jasman, Oh then we can expect to see her in next sem also🙄
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:10:00, Jasman, For classification 2
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:11:00, Kiran, May be
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:11:00, Aditi, No please... 🤮😖
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:11:00, Kirra, she said next sem she will be in Canada
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:11:00, Kirra, haha

2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:12:00, Arsh , cheer up @12363340235
2020-06-23,1900-01-01 18:12:00, Aditi, Jaspreet is the happiest person after hearing this..

2020-06-24,1900-01-01 00:19:00, Nikita , Yup
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 00:23:00,Vivek, not including online*
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 00:23:00,Vivek, that means we are not eligible I guess
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 00:24:00, Jasman, But there are some online courses
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 00:24:00, Jasman, Our courses are not online
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 00:24:00, Jasman, Idk😛

2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:52:00, Amir, it should change to “successfully loaded”
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:52:00, Jaspreet, ok
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:53:00, Jaspreet, This means it is taking time to load in my machine
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:53:00, Amir, maybe
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:53:00, Jaspreet, any other alternatives to this approach
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:54:00, Vedant , Try running
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:55:00, Vedant , If that doesn’t work

2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:56:00, Jaspreet, anyone have seen this before
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:58:00, Amir, have you added all the imports he mentioned in the pdf?
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:58:00, Jaspreet, yes yes
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:59:00, Vedant , import pandas as pd
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 11:59:00, Jaspreet, will try again

2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:35:00, Amir, It seems we can't simply use the way he has mentioned in his pdf
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:36:00,Vasu, True/
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:36:00, Amir, the function must be a javascript-ish style:
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:36:00, Amir, slider.callback = CustomJS(
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:38:00, Naval, Yup
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:38:00, Amir, It maybe a good idea to ask him to demonstrate it himself
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:38:00, Naval, But cannot show output in notebook
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:38:00, Naval, it displays in html
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:39:00, Naval, also port number 5006 should be free
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:39:00, Naval, Because this file gets deployed only in that port
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:39:00, Amir, 👍
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:39:00, Amir, I hope Jas is satisfied now
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:40:00, Amir, Let's hope he doesn't ask for a slider in the exam 🙌
2020-06-24,1900-01-01 15:40:00, Naval, 🤞🤞

2020-06-27,1900-01-01 09:57:00, Amir, @12066199386 would marriage with a person who has a pr help with an automatic pr? or it only works with citizens?

2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:40:00, Kirra, Was there instructions to submit word doc specifically
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:40:00, Kirra, ?
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:40:00, Roberta, There's nothing write on mine
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:40:00, Vedant , She didn’t provide any feedback. Might have only to a few of us.
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:41:00, Roberta, I think she just wrote for you
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:41:00, Naval, You all submitted pdf or word?
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:41:00, Roberta, Word

2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:42:00, Naval, This is fucked up
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:42:00, Amir, I remember something vague about submitting word
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:42:00, Tuli , Inhuman
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:43:00, Naval, Everyone else tells us for pdf
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:43:00, Vedant , God  she is crazy.

2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:44:00, Tuli , I asked for a time slot to have a chat😢
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:45:00, Kirra, Yes tell michael to fire himself
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:45:00, Roberta, I don't think is fair to cut half of your marks
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:45:00, Roberta, Just because you submitted as pdf
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:46:00, Jaspreet, Please check and let me know
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:46:00, Tuli , <Media omitted>

2020-06-29,1900-01-01 09:51:00, Vedant , Reply back to her saying “Give me 90% and I’ll think about it.”
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:02:00, Kania, Actually she did
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:02:00, Kania, <Media omitted>
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:03:00, Roberta, Kania this is assignment
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:03:00, Kirra, Car and anxiety
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:03:00, Roberta, We are talking about midterm
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:03:00, Kirra, It didnt say for midterm
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:03:00, Kania, But that's still crazy to get 50% deducted!!
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:03:00, Kania, Ooohh midterm!
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:03:00, Naval, This is assignment right?
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:03:00, Kania, Sorry! Thought it's for midterm!
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:04:00, Kania, Same instructions were mentioned for both Midterm and assignment
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:05:00, Kania," ""Last_name_First_name_StudentID.docx"""
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:05:00, Kania, Yeah the photo is for assignment.. but midterm mentioned the same thing too
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:06:00, Amir, yeah I think that’s true. That’s why I submitted the word. Now I recalled!
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:06:00,Vasu, What really???
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:06:00, Kania, Yeah check your word doc
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:06:00,Vasu, She is insane

2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:09:00, Kirra, 50% grade deduction for not using docx
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:09:00, Kirra, Yes
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:10:00, Roberta, Even if she posted a disclaimer is too mucjmh of deduction
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:10:00, Roberta, Not fair
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:11:00, Roberta, I didn't have this problem but  I can see that's not fair or reasonable
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:14:00, Naval, I'm getting screwed with all her bullshit schemes
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:14:00, Naval, Now word not pdf
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:15:00, Naval, And when it comes to actual teaching
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:15:00, Naval, she is just copying everything from youtube link

2020-06-29,1900-01-01 10:21:00, Amir, She’s going Oliver Twist level strict on our asses.

2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:26:00,Vasu, The main thing is about pdf as many of us loose marks only because of this things
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:26:00, Kiran, Yeah

2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:27:00, Kirra, She didnt ask us to unstandardize...
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:27:00, Jasman, And less time
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:27:00, Jasman, I agree
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:27:00,Vasu, And I dont think Michael will agree about what we feel about her teaching
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:27:00, Manoj, main point
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:27:00, Beth, unclear instructions
2020-06-29,1900-01-01 20:27:00, Kirra, But many of us assumed we had to standardization

2020-06-30,1900-01-01 10:43:00, Roberta, He should've know that minor crimes doesn't have the same penalty as murder for example
2020-06-30,1900-01-01 10:44:00, Roberta, So if you steal a bread you won't be condemned to life in prison

2020-07-01,1900-01-01 13:31:00, Kirra, 3.	Give examples of when analysts would apply to conduct either Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (4 points)
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 13:31:00, Kirra, in this question does she want us to
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 13:31:00, Kirra, give an example of just one of them?
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 14:02:00, Kirra, <Media omitted>
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 14:29:00,Rashman, Thanx Kirra
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 17:10:00, Amir, where can I find the rationale behind LDA assumptions?
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 17:12:00, Roberta, I tried to explain the assumptions
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 17:13:00, Amir, I can write what i understood but I'm sure she'll cut mark
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 17:14:00, Roberta, I did this
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 17:14:00, Roberta, But she always cut me marks for nothing so
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 18:13:00, Kirra, Google?
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 18:15:00, Amir, no luck
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 18:34:00, Jaspreet, In total we have 2 assumption right
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 18:36:00, Jaspreet, ok
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:32:00, Amir, which plot does she mean by this?
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:35:00, Roberta, I think that one with bars and two groups
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:35:00, Roberta, Like two plots
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:36:00, Amir, <Media omitted>
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:36:00, Amir, this?
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:37:00, Roberta, Yes I guess
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:37:00, Roberta, This is the graph for this data
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:37:00, Roberta, Mine doesn't look like this
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:37:00, Roberta, 🤣
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:37:00, Amir, its not from data

2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:39:00, Roberta, I was worried 🤣
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 19:40:00, Amir, don’t know what is the code for it yet 😄

2020-07-01,1900-01-01 21:32:00, Amir, she has explained the columns in the paper
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 21:33:00, Amir, you could rename columns or just do with the Vs
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 22:17:00, Roberta, You don't need id you can drop or just do lda without by using - ID in the arguments
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 23:16:00, Roberta, Hey
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 23:16:00, Roberta, Only one loading for you too?

2020-07-01,1900-01-01 23:18:00, Roberta, What odd data
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 23:18:00, David, Yes
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 23:23:00, Roberta, Yes

2020-07-01,1900-01-01 23:24:00, Roberta, Like that iris data set of the flowers has 3 kinds of flowers there will be two LD
2020-07-01,1900-01-01 23:31:00, Jaspreet, Yes
2020-07-02,1900-01-01 01:22:00, Kirra, I think there is a third assumption for discriminant analysis
2020-07-02,1900-01-01 01:22:00, Kirra, No outliers

2020-07-09,1900-01-01 12:54:00,Dharun, Just the same number with extended expiry date
2020-07-09,1900-01-01 12:55:00, Kirra, she said we might not be able to extend our SIN on time if it takes us too long to do biometrics
2020-07-09,1900-01-01 12:55:00, Jaspreet, ok
2020-07-09,1900-01-01 12:56:00, Jaspreet, I didn't know SIN expires ?

2020-07-09,1900-01-01 13:15:00, Tuli , How long it takes to process?
