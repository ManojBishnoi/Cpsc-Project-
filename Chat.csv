27/11/2019, 11:26 am , Kirra, She is not gonna mark ur team mate down for that
27/11/2019, 11:26 am , Roberta, But we don't have to do our own feedback
27/11/2019, 11:26 am , Kirra, Yepp
27/11/2019, 11:26 am , Kirra, But even if my team mate gives me 5 0s
27/11/2019, 11:26 am , Roberta, you just have to feedback your team mates and she is going to evaluate based on the rubric
27/11/2019, 11:26 am , Kirra, Shes not gonna minus points for

04/12/2019, 12:29 am , Kirra, Did she calculate that herself?
04/12/2019, 12:29 am , Beth, yes
04/12/2019, 12:30 am , Kirra, How?
04/12/2019, 12:30 am , Kirra, Can u show?

10/02/2020, 7:23 pm ,Dharun," @12368883428 what did Khuram say about the ""pie"" question?"
10/02/2020, 7:23 pm , Edward, Great question
10/02/2020, 7:23 pm , Edward, I will clarify it tonight
10/02/2020, 7:23 pm ,Dharun, Hahaha...
10/02/2020, 7:24 pm ,Dharun, Oh great...
10/02/2020, 9:36 pm ,Dharun, Does anyone know how to get the R²a for 4.88.. from the DANA assignment 2
10/02/2020, 10:53 pm , Kirra, R u talking about 4.88(f)?
10/02/2020, 10:57 pm , Edward, R² ?!🤔
10/02/2020, 10:58 pm , Kania, Isnt that just adjusted r-square? Isn't that in the R output?
10/02/2020, 11:00 pm , Amir, I could not find it ir SAS regression output for that question either
10/02/2020, 11:00 pm , Roberta, there is no output in the book for that question
10/02/2020, 11:00 pm , Roberta, so I think we have to run the model
11/02/2020, 6:54 am ,Dharun, I'm using sas and I'm not able to find that in SAS
11/02/2020, 6:55 am ,Dharun, SAS output only gives R² and not adj-R²
11/02/2020, 8:10 am , Roberta, Gives you adjusted R
11/02/2020, 8:53 am ,Vasu, Yes everytime you have this in output
11/02/2020, 9:02 am , Roberta, On the glm procedure we don't have adjusted r square just the regular
11/02/2020, 9:02 am , Roberta, And we should use glm
11/02/2020, 9:03 am , Roberta, Because is a quadratic regression
11/02/2020, 9:03 am , Roberta, But with the regular one you can get the adjusted
11/02/2020, 9:34 am , Arsh , sometimes i feel 
11/02/2020, 9:35 am , Roberta, Sometimes I feel that I'm in the wrong course
11/02/2020, 9:35 am , Roberta, 😂

11/02/2020, 9:39 am , Arsh , wht the heck is glm

11/02/2020, 9:39 am , Tuli , I think about this everyday
11/02/2020, 12:58 pm , Jaspreet, in this python assignment
11/02/2020, 12:58 pm , Jaspreet, <Media omitted>
11/02/2020, 12:59 pm , Jaspreet, we need to explicitly convert data to percentages or there is some function for that
11/02/2020, 1:00 pm ,Dharun, (100*df['bla bla'].value_counts()[0]) / df.count()
11/02/2020, 1:01 pm , Jaspreet, ok we need to do it by ourself :( Thanks
11/02/2020, 1:01 pm ,Dharun, Ji
11/02/2020, 1:02 pm , Kirra, Whos going to class today?
11/02/2020, 1:10 pm ,Dharun, He will be teaching a new concept today
11/02/2020, 1:10 pm ,Dharun, Or at least that is what he said yesterday.
11/02/2020, 1:11 pm ,Dharun, So... me
11/02/2020, 1:21 pm , Amir, i’m going. Have a message for Khurram?

11/02/2020, 3:32 pm ,Dharun, Even for PDD?
11/02/2020, 3:32 pm ,Dharun, I heard it is not increasing for PDD
11/02/2020, 3:32 pm , Kirra, I think we have more credits next semester
11/02/2020, 3:33 pm , Kirra, Not because of tuition increase
11/02/2020, 3:33 pm ,Dharun, Oh then that's a different thing
11/02/2020, 3:34 pm ,Vasu, 🤨
11/02/2020, 3:44 pm , Tuli , 😩

11/02/2020, 5:32 pm , Kiran, For what
11/02/2020, 5:33 pm , Tuli , avoid the area when heading home
11/02/2020, 5:35 pm , Amir, how does he know my name?!
11/02/2020, 5:36 pm , Amir, or anybody’s?!
11/02/2020, 5:36 pm , Arsh , you mailed him for midterms
11/02/2020, 5:37 pm , Amir, I didn’t attach a picture of me to that email 😄
11/02/2020, 5:53 pm , Arsh , Then be happy
11/02/2020, 5:57 pm , Amir, 😄
11/02/2020, 9:26 pm ,Dharun," Yeah...so I figured out how to do this. Incase anyone is still wondering. By using ""GLM"" you only get R² and getting Adj-R² from R² using formula is too mainstream. "
11/02/2020, 9:27 pm , Roberta, you have to use glm Dharum
11/02/2020, 9:27 pm , Roberta, actually for the first one does not make difference
11/02/2020, 9:27 pm , Roberta, but the last one that you have several predictors make
11/02/2020, 9:28 pm ,Dharun, Yeah for the other things yes..
11/02/2020, 9:28 pm ,Dharun, But if you only need Adj-R² then go with this approach.
11/02/2020, 9:28 pm , Roberta, If you want to use glm procedure and get the adjusted r quared
11/02/2020, 9:28 pm , Roberta, this is the syntax
11/02/2020, 9:29 pm , Roberta, proc glmselect data=naval plot=CriterionPanel;
11/02/2020, 9:29 pm , Vedant , I’m just using Linear Regression function from the task panel. Any ideas on that? 😅
11/02/2020, 9:34 pm , Beth, proc reg data = NAVALBASE_new;
11/02/2020, 9:35 pm , Beth, i got adj r2 for this code.. not sure if i am right
11/02/2020, 9:36 pm , Beth, I use SAS
11/02/2020, 9:37 pm , Vedant , No wonder companies are getting rid of SAS
11/02/2020, 9:42 pm , Vedant , <Media omitted>
11/02/2020, 9:46 pm ,Dharun, I hope we *all* figure out a way to crack the midterm the same way we did this one.🤞🏼

13/02/2020, 12:30 pm , Roberta, But I thought that we need to get the indexes for all the columns
13/02/2020, 12:30 pm , Jaspreet, oh really in that case we need to use for loop

23/02/2020, 9:54 pm , Arsh , partial*
23/02/2020, 9:54 pm , Arsh , @16047219059 ?
23/02/2020, 9:57 pm , Vedant , Should be by individual t-test
23/02/2020, 9:58 pm , Vedant , Second by partial f-test
23/02/2020, 9:58 pm , Arsh , 🤯
23/02/2020, 9:59 pm , Vedant , That’s what I think :P
23/02/2020, 9:59 pm , Arsh , i read conducting individual t is not a good approach so use partial f 
23/02/2020, 9:59 pm , Arsh , 😕
23/02/2020, 10:00 pm , Tuli , Nice
23/02/2020, 10:00 pm , Tuli , Thankyou:)

13/03/2020, 2:44 pm , Kania, Ppl! Have some humanity omg
13/03/2020, 2:45 pm , Roberta, They don't know shit about how the virus works
13/03/2020, 2:46 pm , Roberta, Mask doesn't prevent you to get
13/03/2020, 2:46 pm , Kania, Yeap
13/03/2020, 2:46 pm , Kania, But masks are important for those who are sick
13/03/2020, 2:46 pm , Roberta, Even I that just study like 6m of microbiology know this
13/03/2020, 2:46 pm , Kania, So they don't spread to more ppl
13/03/2020, 2:46 pm , Roberta, Yes is important for those who are sick
13/03/2020, 2:47 pm , Roberta, I'm more curious about Langara behaviour
13/03/2020, 2:47 pm ,Dharun, YES!!!!!!
13/03/2020, 2:47 pm , Roberta, Ok to not cancel classes (although I don't think is the best call)
13/03/2020, 2:47 pm ,Dharun, Friends from other college have their finals *online*

13/03/2020, 2:47 pm , Roberta, Is nuts
13/03/2020, 2:48 pm , Roberta, They should go online with almost every course
13/03/2020, 2:48 pm , Kania, They just keep wanting to believe the risks is low.. as always
13/03/2020, 2:48 pm , Kirra, <Media omitted>
13/03/2020, 2:49 pm , Roberta, To contain the spread is all about prevention
13/03/2020, 2:49 pm , Kirra, These are the type of mask that you should be wearing
13/03/2020, 2:49 pm , Roberta, So they are waiting someone got sick to stop classes
13/03/2020, 2:49 pm , Roberta, But when someone discovers that ok I'm sick
13/03/2020, 2:50 pm , Roberta, They already spreaded virus through the entire campus
13/03/2020, 2:50 pm , Roberta, Also there are people who are very poor in hygiene
13/03/2020, 2:50 pm , Kania, I think just don't touch your face before washing your hands
13/03/2020, 2:50 pm , Kania, Totally!! Ppl on the buses and trains still cough yawns sneezes w/o covering their mouths

16/03/2020, 9:00 pm , Cici, Any one got same result for chunks and whole df in task 5?
16/03/2020, 9:01 pm , Vedant , Not supposed to be the same
16/03/2020, 9:01 pm , Cici, What about task6?
16/03/2020, 9:01 pm , Vedant , Working on it
16/03/2020, 9:03 pm , Cici, I got different result again in task 6🤦🏻‍♀️
16/03/2020, 9:03 pm , Cici, I know...
16/03/2020, 9:03 pm , Cici, Why we have to create list first🤦🏻‍♀️
16/03/2020, 9:03 pm , Vedant , I don’t get this guy. So weird.
16/03/2020, 9:04 pm , Cici, Maybe he just want to test you how to create list and then append it
16/03/2020, 9:07 pm , Vedant , Bring it on lol
16/03/2020, 9:20 pm , Kirra, Maybe its also spposed to be diffeent?
16/03/2020, 9:20 pm , Kirra, For task 6?
16/03/2020, 9:22 pm , Vedant , Don’t know yet
16/03/2020, 10:40 pm ,Dharun, You have to get different results for Df and the chucks
16/03/2020, 10:40 pm ,Dharun, For both task 5 & 6 it has to be different.
16/03/2020, 10:40 pm ,Dharun, And his following questions does not ask if they are the same..
16/03/2020, 10:41 pm ,Dharun, They ask if you agree with what you see and how to avoid the difference.
16/03/2020, 10:42 pm ,Dharun, breaking the data into chunks to read in the data is a good method to import data. But using the dataset as chunks is bound to give faulty answers.
16/03/2020, 10:43 pm ,Dharun, This is what I know. And I think this makes sense.
16/03/2020, 10:44 pm , Kiran, This message was deleted
16/03/2020, 10:44 pm , Kiran, Yes ved
16/03/2020, 10:44 pm ,Dharun, And I am not going to change my code cuz it's 1 mark in a 10 mark assignment which has a 0.06% value...
16/03/2020, 10:44 pm ,Dharun, Which means this 1 mark is 0.006%>
16/03/2020, 10:44 pm ,Dharun, !*
16/03/2020, 10:45 pm ,Dharun, So I am done trying to understand his Christopher Nolan genre questions.

17/03/2020, 12:59 pm , Vedant , You create one presentation and record voiceovers for your part. Then merge all the voiceovers and align it with your presentation. Too much work.

17/03/2020, 4:57 pm ,Dharun, My only source of information for now is this group.
17/03/2020, 4:57 pm , David, We should have a final on the coronavirus news. We will all pass. Except Dharun
17/03/2020, 4:58 pm , Roberta, 😂😂
17/03/2020, 4:59 pm , Roberta, Yeah is global
17/03/2020, 4:59 pm ,Dharun, Yaay...
17/03/2020, 4:59 pm , Roberta, The global economy will melt
17/03/2020, 4:59 pm ,Dharun, Now I'm not the only one who is poor
17/03/2020, 4:59 pm , Roberta, Is a matter of time
17/03/2020, 5:00 pm , Roberta, I lost some money in Br
17/03/2020, 5:00 pm , David, Trump wants to inject 1 trillion dollar in the economy. That is humongous to save it. They're desperate
17/03/2020, 5:00 pm ,Dharun, Oh...
17/03/2020, 5:00 pm , Roberta, Because Ibov is melting down
17/03/2020, 5:00 pm ,Dharun, That sounds bad
17/03/2020, 5:00 pm , Roberta, The us dollars cost now 5 reals
17/03/2020, 5:01 pm , Roberta, I nerve heard about circuit braker in us
17/03/2020, 5:01 pm , Roberta, Last week was one
17/03/2020, 5:01 pm , Kirra, Bad for us international students
17/03/2020, 5:01 pm ,Dharun, Omg .. you guys are making me panic ..
17/03/2020, 5:01 pm , Roberta, Also small companies will suffer
17/03/2020, 5:01 pm , Roberta, Because they can't be open

17/03/2020, 5:02 pm , Kirra, Canada will decrease permanent residency visas in the next few years because of recession
17/03/2020, 5:02 pm , Roberta, I think they should at least pause for two weeks
17/03/2020, 5:02 pm , Roberta, Maybe other way
17/03/2020, 5:02 pm , David, Oh my gosh. And we're just starting. Restaurants have had less than 50% in customers for 2 weeks in anrow and more business are closing causing no cashflow.
17/03/2020, 5:02 pm , Roberta, They increase
17/03/2020, 5:02 pm , Jasman, Yeahh
17/03/2020, 5:03 pm , Roberta, They rely on immigrants to pay taxes
17/03/2020, 5:03 pm , Roberta, The whole canadian pension system need of immigrants
17/03/2020, 5:03 pm , Jasman, Their economy has increased just because of immigrants/ international students
17/03/2020, 5:04 pm ,Dharun, Wow... I feel dumb ..
17/03/2020, 5:04 pm , Amir, we should ask langara to put our tuition into instalments to be paid in the future
17/03/2020, 5:04 pm , Roberta, Also we have to account that these kind of diseases could create a panic fear worldwide
17/03/2020, 5:05 pm , Roberta, That will reduce immigration moviment
17/03/2020, 5:05 pm ,Dharun, https://www.instagram.com/p/B91pGBRF-rB/?igshid=kn9zdgm5r1lm
17/03/2020, 5:05 pm , Roberta, Because we can see that anti globalization agenda is  based on closed markets and less immigration
17/03/2020, 5:06 pm , Kirra, Now is the best time to buy stocks though 🤣
17/03/2020, 5:06 pm , Roberta, Maybe the corona will give more strength to this political setup
17/03/2020, 5:06 pm , Roberta, Or on the other hand people can ask for more social protection and bigger welfare state

18/03/2020, 2:04 pm , Roberta, Dana midterm2 still going to be monday?
18/03/2020, 2:14 pm , Jaspreet, in last question DANA assignment we need to remove two outlier or one
18/03/2020, 2:17 pm , Kania, i removed 2
18/03/2020, 2:17 pm , Jaspreet, ok
18/03/2020, 2:24 pm , Roberta, I removed one
18/03/2020, 2:30 pm , Jaspreet, so in both cases we are rejecting null hypothesis
18/03/2020, 2:30 pm , Jaspreet, means I am rejecting null in both
18/03/2020, 2:32 pm , Roberta, With outlier reject
18/03/2020, 2:32 pm , Roberta, Without outlier fail to reject
18/03/2020, 2:33 pm , Jaspreet, but if we remove both outlier
18/03/2020, 2:33 pm , Jaspreet, rejects null in both cases
18/03/2020, 2:33 pm , Roberta, Have to check but I don't think so
18/03/2020, 2:36 pm , Kirra, Only 31
18/03/2020, 2:36 pm , Kirra, Is outlier
18/03/2020, 2:36 pm , Kirra, @12363340235
18/03/2020, 2:36 pm , Kirra, I think lol
18/03/2020, 2:37 pm , Jaspreet, box plot there are two right
18/03/2020, 2:37 pm , Roberta, I just excluded 31
18/03/2020, 2:41 pm , Kirra, <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 2:41 pm , Kirra, they didnt consider -13 to be a significant outlier
18/03/2020, 2:41 pm , Roberta, <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 2:42 pm , Kirra, really?
18/03/2020, 2:42 pm , Kirra, so -13 is also an outlier?
18/03/2020, 2:42 pm , Roberta, <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 2:43 pm , Roberta, So @17788855554  @12363340235  giving the nature of the question I think It does make difference the outlier and you should remove only 31
18/03/2020, 2:44 pm , Roberta, Doesn't make any sense reject in both answers
18/03/2020, 2:44 pm , Kania, Oh I just based it on boxplot
18/03/2020, 2:45 pm , Kania, I alr submitted it so 🤷
18/03/2020, 2:46 pm , Jaspreet, hmm
18/03/2020, 3:08 pm , Roberta, should be reject with outlier
18/03/2020, 3:08 pm , Roberta, fail to without
18/03/2020, 3:08 pm , Roberta, @kania if you feel so you can overwrite your subscription

19/03/2020, 12:39 am , Roberta, A but there's not enough evidence
19/03/2020, 12:40 am , Kirra, 🤣
19/03/2020, 12:41 am , David, There's almost not enough evidence for anything right now. This thing is getting worse by the minute and people are trying to figure it out.
19/03/2020, 12:41 am , Kania, I'm just reading articles and I'm alr mentally drained.. can't imagine those on the front line working nonstop to fight the virus 😭
19/03/2020, 12:42 am , Vedant , Wait till it spreads in India. I highly doubt the government would be able to control it or rather do anything at all.
19/03/2020, 12:42 am , Kirra, ^ especially with that population density
19/03/2020, 12:42 am , Vedant , Exactly.
19/03/2020, 12:42 am , Kania, Did India close their borders?
19/03/2020, 12:43 am , Vedant , They did
19/03/2020, 12:43 am , Kirra, Is it crazy we have 8 deaths altogether in Canada... and 7 of it is in BC
19/03/2020, 12:44 am , Kania, Because they keep telling ppl to self isolate
19/03/2020, 12:44 am , Vedant , BC has older people with lower immunities. That has an effect.
19/03/2020, 12:45 am , Kania, It's not going to work~ the virus spreads thru the vents etc. That's why they installed negative air pressure rooms for outbreaks.. idk what the govt are thinking
19/03/2020, 12:46 am , Kania, Yeah but will the person really stay at home?
19/03/2020, 12:46 am , Kania, Who can guarantee? Who's gonna get food for them?
19/03/2020, 12:47 am , Vedant , That’s the whole point. What about people who don’t have a home!
19/03/2020, 12:47 am , David, It actually can stay in the air for a  while
19/03/2020, 12:48 am , Kania, Yeap. Hk suspected that too when the whole apartment was infected after one person was tested positive. Then again it could be them touching contaminated surfaces
19/03/2020, 12:49 am , David, Nations have no other option than to keep their people in as much isolation and closing people businesses
19/03/2020, 12:49 am , Vedant , Just stay safe and isolated guys. Go to work only if it doesn’t involve contact with people and take all precautions.
19/03/2020, 12:50 am , Kania, Yeap 😭
19/03/2020, 12:50 am , David, We're headed into a global recession. Never a dull moment for us.
19/03/2020, 12:51 am , David, I'm already tired of staying home haha and it's been only a few days... Haha
19/03/2020, 12:51 am , Kania, I love it!!
19/03/2020, 12:52 am , Kania, 😂
19/03/2020, 12:52 am , David, So much speculation going around. Very dangerous
19/03/2020, 12:52 am , Kania, But I'd much prefer to be in Singapore right now..
19/03/2020, 12:52 am , David, Haha so much for coming back on time after spring break
19/03/2020, 12:52 am , David, Haha and gold
19/03/2020, 12:54 am , Kania, Hahah
19/03/2020, 12:54 am , Kania, Everything is so cheap now!
19/03/2020, 12:54 am , Kirra, Buy your stocks when it hits rock bttm
19/03/2020, 12:54 am , Kania, But it will keep going down
19/03/2020, 12:55 am , David, Yes. Plan to retire early hahaha
19/03/2020, 12:55 am , Kania, Until a vaccine is developed...
19/03/2020, 12:56 am , Kania, I thought we at the point worst than the IMF 2008?
19/03/2020, 12:56 am , David, Oh Vedant. At this point is inevitable. The Rock has just hit the water . Wait for the waves
19/03/2020, 12:56 am , Kania, Financial crisis I mean
19/03/2020, 12:57 am , David, So bad. The plunge is as bad if not even worse (and it's not over yet) AND so much more debt everywhere AND dozens of industries are being mutilated right now
19/03/2020, 12:58 am , David, All at the same time
19/03/2020, 12:58 am , David, Which was not the case in 2008
19/03/2020, 12:58 am , Vedant , Netflix and Zoom Meetings will surely make tons of money

20/03/2020, 11:13 pm , Amir, I’m losing faith in WHO. Was completely useless in Corona case to say the least. Admired Iranian health system and was late to react and issue warning. Ignored early warning issued by Hong Kong in favor of Chinese government.
20/03/2020, 11:17 pm , Kania, But they claimed that countries were not doing anything despite their warning

04/04/2020, 9:21 pm , Jaspreet, yes yes
04/04/2020, 9:24 pm , Cici, i mean how can she tell if we are using the internet or not?
04/04/2020, 9:25 pm , Cici, We are supposed to do everything on laptop
04/04/2020, 9:25 pm , Tuli , useless
04/04/2020, 9:25 pm , Kirra, Exactly
04/04/2020, 9:25 pm , Kirra, Lol
04/04/2020, 9:26 pm , Roberta, How she will know if we are using internet
04/04/2020, 9:26 pm , Roberta, This doesn't make any sense
04/04/2020, 9:26 pm , Kirra, I mean if she decides that we do screensharing instead of
04/04/2020, 9:26 pm , Kirra, Camera
04/04/2020, 9:27 pm , Cici, also how she will know if we are talking to each other?
04/04/2020, 9:27 pm , Kirra, Some people have 2 laptops
04/04/2020, 9:27 pm , Kirra, Haha
04/04/2020, 9:27 pm , Navjot , 😂😂
04/04/2020, 9:27 pm , Cici, you are typing too much words?
04/04/2020, 9:27 pm , Roberta, The sad part is that I'll need to change I can't stay on camera in my pjs
04/04/2020, 9:27 pm , Navjot , Exactly
04/04/2020, 9:27 pm , Cici, I don't think so
04/04/2020, 9:28 pm , Kirra, Nope
04/04/2020, 9:28 pm , Cici, also we have to look at each other's face through the whole exam
04/04/2020, 9:28 pm , Cici, it will make me laugh
04/04/2020, 9:29 pm , Roberta, Actually don't because I'll stay looking to my word
04/04/2020, 9:29 pm , Roberta, And let the zoom minimized
04/04/2020, 9:29 pm , Cici, a lot of instructor did this
04/04/2020, 9:30 pm , Cici, i guess she just want you to know that she is watching you
04/04/2020, 9:30 pm ,Rashman, Some people have internet issues too 🙄🙄
04/04/2020, 9:30 pm , Vedant , She can piss off.
04/04/2020, 9:31 pm , Amir, The big brother is watching you comrade
04/04/2020, 9:33 pm , Amir, She put so much unwanted stress on me this term and she continues to do so up until this very last moment. Just can’t take it anymore.
04/04/2020, 9:33 pm , Tuli , yeah
04/04/2020, 9:34 pm , Harshad, <Media omitted>
04/04/2020, 9:35 pm , Cici, Highly agree
04/04/2020, 9:39 pm , Kirra, What if ur laptop doesnt have a camera haha 🤣
04/04/2020, 9:39 pm , Tuli , exactly
04/04/2020, 9:39 pm , Tuli , hahah
04/04/2020, 9:48 pm , Arsh , zoom runs in same browser
04/04/2020, 9:49 pm , Kirra, ?
04/04/2020, 9:49 pm , Aditi, 😣
04/04/2020, 9:50 pm , Arsh , i mean if anybody googles
04/04/2020, 9:50 pm , Kirra, But i use the zoom app
04/04/2020, 9:50 pm , Arsh , i am assuming this 🤔
04/04/2020, 9:50 pm , Jasman, Yeah
04/04/2020, 9:50 pm , Harshad, 😂😂
04/04/2020, 9:50 pm , Kirra, Not browser based
04/04/2020, 9:50 pm , Harshad, We reject your hypothesis
04/04/2020, 9:51 pm , Kirra, And conclude that zoom does not share cookies with emmap
04/04/2020, 9:51 pm , Arsh , even through app it launches in browser no?
04/04/2020, 9:51 pm , Harshad, No
04/04/2020, 9:51 pm , Kirra, Well she gave link
04/04/2020, 9:51 pm , Cici, she is going to check our cookies?
04/04/2020, 9:52 pm , Arsh , she is insane
04/04/2020, 9:52 pm , Arsh , she ll go to any extent
04/04/2020, 9:52 pm , Vedant , She can’t do it without written consent. That’s the law.
04/04/2020, 9:53 pm , Kirra, We can sue langara if that happens
04/04/2020, 9:53 pm , Kirra, Make some dollars
04/04/2020, 9:53 pm , Aditi, 🤣🤣
04/04/2020, 9:53 pm , Vedant , Dollars X 2
04/04/2020, 9:54 pm , Vedant , Nope. Runs in the background.
04/04/2020, 9:54 pm , Kirra, I am wondering if she meant d2l lock
04/04/2020, 9:54 pm , Vedant , Otherwise how do plan to work on your exam
04/04/2020, 9:54 pm , Arsh , woth camera on
04/04/2020, 9:54 pm , Vedant , *do you
04/04/2020, 9:54 pm , Vedant , Yes
04/04/2020, 9:55 pm , Cici, she wants us to mute our self
04/04/2020, 9:55 pm , Cici, even we are talking
04/04/2020, 9:55 pm , Kirra, Wait she said cant use the internet
04/04/2020, 9:55 pm , Cici, she can't hear us
04/04/2020, 9:55 pm , Harshad, We can wear a mask 😂
04/04/2020, 9:55 pm , Kirra, Means we can turnoff our wifi
04/04/2020, 9:56 pm , Vedant , Hahaha
04/04/2020, 9:57 pm , Cici, then zoom will only show your profile photo to her
04/04/2020, 9:57 pm , Roberta, The only thing that intrigued me is that she said before open book and now no internet
04/04/2020, 9:58 pm , Roberta, I'll just open zoom on firefox and my exam I can google it stuff on google chrome
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm , Kirra, But she said no internet.. using zoom is technically using the internet we can argue with her that way...
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm , Roberta, Then I skip the cookies problem
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm , Kirra, Is there really a cookies issue
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm , Roberta, But I don't think she's really check this
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm , Roberta, And even if this is possible shareable with her
04/04/2020, 10:00 pm , Roberta, Because there's privacy issues regarding this right?
04/04/2020, 10:00 pm , Kirra, Imma try and click on the link now
04/04/2020, 10:02 pm , Tuli , it seems like usual meeting
04/04/2020, 10:02 pm , Kirra, Yeah its like a normal meetinng
04/04/2020, 10:03 pm , Jasman, What if she asks us to share screen
04/04/2020, 10:03 pm , Tuli , only one can do at a time
04/04/2020, 10:03 pm , Jasman, No
04/04/2020, 10:03 pm , Jasman, Multiple participants can share at the same time
04/04/2020, 10:03 pm , Tuli , and i dont think she wants class to see answers
04/04/2020, 10:04 pm , Jasman, <Media omitted>
04/04/2020, 10:04 pm , Kirra, Then we can use 2 laptops
04/04/2020, 10:04 pm , Kirra, 1 laptop will be the screen share and the other laptop will be the non screen share one... where we can google
04/04/2020, 10:05 pm , Roberta, But she will see you moving from one laptop to another
04/04/2020, 10:05 pm , Roberta, I kust think that you guys are overthinking this
04/04/2020, 10:06 pm , Amir, run separate zoom with the person you want to cheat with and silently share screens
04/04/2020, 10:06 pm , Kirra, If we screenshare she can only see the screenshare not camera
04/04/2020, 10:07 pm , Jasman, Can a person share screen and camera simultaneously on zoom?
04/04/2020, 10:07 pm , Kirra, Not sure about this if someone has experience lmk
04/04/2020, 10:07 pm , Kirra, I dont think so though
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Roberta, She'll not ask you to screenshare
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Tuli , if we share the screen ppl can see their paper
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Tuli , its not practical
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Jasman, 😂😂😂
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Roberta, The thing that bothered her is that people communicate
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Roberta, She will watching in zoom
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Kirra, 🤣
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Jasman, Only Emma can see
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Kirra, I forgot about this
04/04/2020, 10:08 pm , Roberta, Just to make sure that you're not talking to anyone
04/04/2020, 10:09 pm , Kirra, You can also creats a video loop of urself
04/04/2020, 10:09 pm , Kirra, Create*
04/04/2020, 10:10 pm , Kirra, So she thinks its u lol but its just a video loop haha
04/04/2020, 10:10 pm , Tuli , hahahah
04/04/2020, 10:10 pm , Roberta, Study will be lesser work than create a loop video
04/04/2020, 10:10 pm , Kirra, 👆
04/04/2020, 10:10 pm , Kirra, True that
04/04/2020, 10:11 pm , Navjot , If we will share our screens then we are able to see everyone's answer right?
04/04/2020, 10:11 pm , Navjot , Because we will work in word
04/04/2020, 10:11 pm , Amir, what’s the overall minimum grade to pass?
04/04/2020, 10:11 pm , Tuli , 60
04/04/2020, 10:12 pm , Jasman, C
04/04/2020, 10:12 pm , Tuli , with 50 for finals
04/04/2020, 10:12 pm , Kirra, 58% overall
04/04/2020, 10:12 pm , Kirra, 50% for finals
04/04/2020, 10:23 pm , Cici, What does 50% for final means
04/04/2020, 10:23 pm , Cici, You have to reach 50% in finals then you are eligible to pass?
04/04/2020, 10:24 pm , Amir, supposedly
04/04/2020, 10:24 pm , Kirra, <Media omitted>
04/04/2020, 10:26 pm , Cici, Hahahahahahah
04/04/2020, 10:33 pm , Roberta, Yes
04/04/2020, 10:34 pm , Roberta, But I have a friend who passed in financial accounting without getting 50% in the final
04/04/2020, 10:34 pm , Roberta, So I never now if this rule is actually true

17/04/2020, 9:32 am , Nikita , True
17/04/2020, 9:33 am , Amir, The problem with this exam was its dependency on q1 which required a bit of experience with data structure
17/04/2020, 9:33 am , Kirra, Michael gave him a lecture on how to be mean to us because of the emma incident haha
17/04/2020, 9:35 am , Roberta, The other questions I agree
17/04/2020, 9:35 am , Roberta, But question one
17/04/2020, 9:35 am , Roberta, Was a freaking nightmare
17/04/2020, 9:35 am , Amir, now most of us got stuck in q1 and panicked which influenced the whole thing
17/04/2020, 9:35 am , Amir, and we could not simply move on from q1
17/04/2020, 9:36 am , Roberta, And if you don't get question one right you don't have the df_detail that is needed to do the other questions properly
17/04/2020, 9:37 am , Naval, Also the memory issue
17/04/2020, 9:38 am , Amir, did anybody else encounter the memory issue?
17/04/2020, 9:38 am , Naval, 8gb Ram was unable to handle so many files/df
17/04/2020, 9:40 am , Roberta, All the time I had that hourglass on the top
17/04/2020, 9:42 am ,Vasu, In my case some of my command never runs nor give a error
17/04/2020, 9:42 am ,Vasu, Lets hope he consider our emails
17/04/2020, 9:42 am , Roberta, Guys and business?
17/04/2020, 9:42 am , Roberta, Still unable to register
17/04/2020, 9:43 am , Roberta, How will I know how much to pay?
17/04/2020, 9:45 am , Kirra, Add 1700 CAD to whatever u have to pay now
17/04/2020, 9:45 am ,Vasu, Its (565*3)=1695
17/04/2020, 9:45 am , Roberta, Michael didn't solve this yet

21/04/2020, 7:08 pm , Naval, Is it mandatory to get 50% in final exam???
21/04/2020, 7:12 pm , Roberta, It supposed to be
21/04/2020, 7:12 pm , Roberta, But I've never learn about someone failing because this rule
21/04/2020, 7:12 pm , Kirra, Dont worry about it
21/04/2020, 7:12 pm , Roberta, And he said that he improved the grades
21/04/2020, 7:12 pm , Kirra, He only cares about overall
21/04/2020, 7:13 pm , Naval, I hope so
21/04/2020, 7:14 pm , Kirra, As long as ur overall grade is 55% u will pass
21/04/2020, 7:34 pm , Nicky, Anyone has Khurram phone number? I need to call him as he added wrong grades for me
21/04/2020, 7:40 pm , Kania, Same... You guys might wanna double check his calculation
21/04/2020, 7:41 pm , Kirra, Which one?
21/04/2020, 7:41 pm , Kirra, Did he particularly miscalculate?
21/04/2020, 7:41 pm , Kania, CPSC overall
21/04/2020, 7:41 pm , Kania, Idk if it's rounding error?
21/04/2020, 7:43 pm , Kirra, He hasnt done overall grade?
21/04/2020, 7:43 pm , Kirra, Yet
21/04/2020, 7:43 pm , Nicky, I mean final exam grade
21/04/2020, 7:43 pm , Kania, Oh right.. I mixed up overall grade and final grade 🙊
21/04/2020, 7:43 pm , Kania, Sorry for confusion
21/04/2020, 7:44 pm , Kirra, Dont look at the letter grade he put in the right side
21/04/2020, 7:45 pm , Kirra, Just look at the points
21/04/2020, 7:45 pm , Nicky, Yes I did
21/04/2020, 7:46 pm , Nicky, I mean I received B+ 24/35 but as what he wrote in his annoucement I should have A- 27/35. So I think it is typing mistake
21/04/2020, 7:47 pm , Kirra, ohh A- is supposed to be the overall grade
21/04/2020, 7:47 pm , Kirra, ^^^ he is talking about overall grade in this one
21/04/2020, 7:48 pm , Kirra, so he will bump you up from A- to A
21/04/2020, 7:48 pm , Nicky, Uhm yes it makes sense
21/04/2020, 7:49 pm , Vedant , The grades are calculated by the system. Khurram only puts in the scores. Just make sure your scores and totals are correct.
21/04/2020, 7:51 pm , Vedant , He most likely won’t. I think that marks increase offer was only for those who got a lesser grade than C. But I hope I’m wrong.
21/04/2020, 7:53 pm ,Vasu, Do Khurram update overall grade?
21/04/2020, 7:53 pm , Nicky, Yes I think I misunderstand between overall score and final score
21/04/2020, 7:53 pm , Kirra, he said he will add for everyone
21/04/2020, 7:53 pm , Kirra, no but u can calculate your score
21/04/2020, 9:22 pm ,Vasu, Do you get chance to call khurram?
21/04/2020, 11:23 pm , Nicky, No I dont have his number
22/04/2020, 12:14 am , Kirra, He added 3% to everyone
22/04/2020, 12:15 am , Kirra, Calculate ur total now

19/05/2020, 3:30 pm , Tuli , yes
19/05/2020, 3:31 pm , Jasman, Yes and I don’t think there is any point to do work term if the duration of pgwp will be the same
19/05/2020, 3:31 pm , Jasman, Why to pay langara for finding a job ourselves
19/05/2020, 3:39 pm , Jasman, Yeah it’s more work
19/05/2020, 3:39 pm , Jasman, And we have to pay for it😂

22/06/2020, 4:56 pm ,Vasu, Look the evaluator
22/06/2020, 4:56 pm , Amir, 😄
22/06/2020, 4:56 pm , Roberta, Anyway say the true
22/06/2020, 4:56 pm , Kirra, the instructors will read it at least
22/06/2020, 4:56 pm , Roberta, at least let's give him a headache
22/06/2020, 4:56 pm , Amir, and we have already complained like a thousand times to him
22/06/2020, 4:57 pm , Kirra, at least for azadeh i told her to take notes from sharon and emma when writing lecture notes/powerpoint...
22/06/2020, 4:57 pm , Kiran, that asshole pretends to be dumb when comes to feedback anyway
22/06/2020, 4:57 pm , Roberta, complain is a second nature for me

22/06/2020, 4:58 pm ,Vasu, Great Insight
22/06/2020, 4:58 pm , Roberta, But if we answer good things only it will look like  everything is fine
22/06/2020, 4:58 pm , Roberta, I don't even care to be anonymous anymore
22/06/2020, 4:58 pm , Kirra, THIS
22/06/2020, 4:58 pm , Roberta, I could say what I wrote on Monica's face
22/06/2020, 4:58 pm , Naval, I Agree
22/06/2020, 4:58 pm , Amir, it's anonymous but not that anonymous 😄
22/06/2020, 4:59 pm , Roberta, I think they always knows
22/06/2020, 4:59 pm , Harshad, Same.
22/06/2020, 4:59 pm , Roberta, so I try to be honest without being personal
22/06/2020, 4:59 pm , Roberta, for Monica I said  that she doesn't provide enough time to activities

22/06/2020, 5:00 pm ,Vasu, Very brief

22/06/2020, 5:00 pm , Roberta, Also I said that her way of doing things creates stress among students
22/06/2020, 5:00 pm ,Vasu, True
22/06/2020, 5:00 pm , Kirra, i wrote 5 paragraphs for azadeh and i said that her lecture notes were useless and she should learn from our previous dana instructors...
22/06/2020, 5:01 pm , Naval, 👏👏
22/06/2020, 5:02 pm , Roberta, since she shows favoritism and her expectations are way bigger than what she gives back

22/06/2020, 5:02 pm , Roberta, her slides are useless my words
22/06/2020, 5:02 pm , Roberta, her grading criteria not clear
22/06/2020, 5:03 pm , Harshad, Agreed

23/06/2020, 5:55 pm , Roberta, For me the worst is that she uses the same words as the lady in the video
23/06/2020, 5:55 pm ,Dharun, She didn't even bother to make her own presentation

23/06/2020, 6:06 pm , Amir, This session breaks the most Whatsapp messages sent during a lecture.
23/06/2020, 6:06 pm ,Vasu, Thats why he is so curious
23/06/2020, 6:07 pm , Aditi, There's no other reason to date her😏🤣
23/06/2020, 6:08 pm ,Vasu, Good Choice bro

23/06/2020, 6:09 pm , Jasman, Canada*
23/06/2020, 6:10 pm , Jasman, I don’t think she has
23/06/2020, 6:10 pm , Kirra, yes but probably Langara sponsored her PR already
23/06/2020, 6:10 pm , Kirra, by now

24/06/2020, 12:23 am ,Vivek, not including online*
24/06/2020, 12:23 am ,Vivek, that means we are not eligible I guess
24/06/2020, 12:24 am , Jasman, But there are some online courses
24/06/2020, 12:24 am , Jasman, Our courses are not online
24/06/2020, 12:24 am , Jasman, Idk😛
24/06/2020, 11:51 am , Jaspreet, <Media omitted>
24/06/2020, 11:52 am , Amir, it should change to “successfully loaded”
24/06/2020, 11:52 am , Jaspreet, ok
24/06/2020, 11:53 am , Jaspreet, This means it is taking time to load in my machine
24/06/2020, 11:53 am , Amir, maybe
24/06/2020, 11:53 am , Jaspreet, any other alternatives to this approach
24/06/2020, 11:54 am , Vedant , Try running
24/06/2020, 11:55 am , Vedant , If that doesn’t work
24/06/2020, 11:56 am , Jaspreet, <Media omitted>
24/06/2020, 11:56 am , Jaspreet, anyone have seen this before
24/06/2020, 11:58 am , Amir, have you added all the imports he mentioned in the pdf?

24/06/2020, 2:39 pm , Jaspreet, <Media omitted>
24/06/2020, 3:35 pm , Amir, It seems we can't simply use the way he has mentioned in his pdf
24/06/2020, 3:36 pm ,Vasu, True/
24/06/2020, 3:36 pm , Amir, the function must be a javascript-ish style:
24/06/2020, 3:36 pm , Amir, slider.callback = CustomJS(
24/06/2020, 3:38 pm , Naval, Yup
24/06/2020, 3:38 pm , Amir, It maybe a good idea to ask him to demonstrate it himself
24/06/2020, 3:38 pm , Naval, But cannot show output in notebook
24/06/2020, 3:38 pm , Naval, it displays in html
24/06/2020, 3:39 pm , Naval, also port number 5006 should be free
24/06/2020, 3:39 pm , Naval, Because this file gets deployed only in that port
24/06/2020, 3:39 pm , Amir, 👍
24/06/2020, 3:39 pm , Amir, I hope Jas is satisfied now
24/06/2020, 3:40 pm , Amir, Let's hope he doesn't ask for a slider in the exam 🙌
