2020-02-10 22:57:00, Edward, R² ?!🤔,Monday
2020-02-10 22:58:00, Kania, Isnt that just adjusted r-square? Isn't that in the R output?,Monday
2020-02-10 23:00:00, Amir, I could not find it ir SAS regression output for that question either,Monday
2020-02-10 23:00:00, Roberta, there is no output in the book for that question,Monday
2020-02-10 23:00:00, Roberta, so I think we have to run the model,Monday
2020-02-11 06:54:00,Dharun, I'm using sas and I'm not able to find that in SAS,Tuesday
2020-02-11 06:55:00,Dharun, SAS output only gives R² and not adj-R²,Tuesday
2020-02-11 08:10:00, Roberta, Gives you adjusted R,Tuesday
2020-02-11 08:53:00,Vasu, Yes everytime you have this in output,Tuesday
2020-02-11 09:02:00, Roberta, On the glm procedure we don't have adjusted r square just the regular,Tuesday
2020-02-11 09:02:00, Roberta, And we should use glm,Tuesday
2020-02-11 09:03:00, Roberta, Because is a quadratic regression,Tuesday

2020-02-11 17:57:00, Amir, 😄,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:26:00,Dharun," Yeah...so I figured out how to do this. Incase anyone is still wondering. By using ""GLM"" you only get R² and getting Adj-R² from R² using formula is too mainstream. ",Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:27:00, Roberta, you have to use glm Dharum,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:27:00, Roberta, actually for the first one does not make difference,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:27:00, Roberta, but the last one that you have several predictors make,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:28:00,Dharun, Yeah for the other things yes..,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:28:00,Dharun, But if you only need Adj-R² then go with this approach.,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:28:00, Roberta, If you want to use glm procedure and get the adjusted r quared,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:28:00, Roberta, this is the syntax,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:29:00, Roberta, proc glmselect data=naval plot=CriterionPanel;,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:29:00, Vedant , I’m just using Linear Regression function from the task panel. Any ideas on that? 😅,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:34:00, Beth, proc reg data = NAVALBASE_new;,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:35:00, Beth, i got adj r2 for this code.. not sure if i am right,Tuesday
2020-02-11 21:36:00, Beth, I use SAS,Tuesday

2020-04-04 21:50:00, Harshad, We reject your hypothesis,Saturday
2020-04-04 21:51:00, Kirra, And conclude that zoom does not share cookies with emmap,Saturday

2020-04-04 21:57:00, Roberta, The only thing that intrigued me is that she said before open book and now no internet,Saturday
2020-04-04 21:58:00, Roberta, I'll just open zoom on firefox and my exam I can google it stuff on google chrome,Saturday
2020-04-04 21:59:00, Kirra, But she said no internet.. using zoom is technically using the internet we can argue with her that way...,Saturday
2020-04-04 21:59:00, Roberta, Then I skip the cookies problem,Saturday

2020-04-21 19:12:00, Roberta, But I've never learn about someone failing because this rule,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:12:00, Kirra, Dont worry about it,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:12:00, Roberta, And he said that he improved the grades,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:12:00, Kirra, He only cares about overall,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:13:00, Naval, I hope so,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:14:00, Kirra, As long as ur overall grade is 55% u will pass,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:34:00, Nicky, Anyone has Khurram phone number? I need to call him as he added wrong grades for me,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:40:00, Kania, Same... You guys might wanna double check his calculation,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:41:00, Kirra, Which one?,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:41:00, Kirra, Did he particularly miscalculate?,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:41:00, Kania, CPSC overall,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:41:00, Kania, Idk if it's rounding error?,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:43:00, Kirra, He hasnt done overall grade?,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:43:00, Kirra, Yet,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:43:00, Nicky, I mean final exam grade,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:43:00, Kania, Oh right.. I mixed up overall grade and final grade 🙊,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:43:00, Kania, Sorry for confusion,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:44:00, Kirra, Dont look at the letter grade he put in the right side,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:45:00, Kirra, Just look at the points,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:45:00, Nicky, Yes I did,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:46:00, Nicky, I mean I received B+ 24/35 but as what he wrote in his annoucement I should have A- 27/35. So I think it is typing mistake,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:47:00, Kirra, ohh A- is supposed to be the overall grade,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:47:00, Kirra, ^^^ he is talking about overall grade in this one,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:48:00, Kirra, so he will bump you up from A- to A,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:48:00, Nicky, Uhm yes it makes sense,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:49:00, Vedant , The grades are calculated by the system. Khurram only puts in the scores. Just make sure your scores and totals are correct.,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:51:00, Vedant , He most likely won’t. I think that marks increase offer was only for those who got a lesser grade than C. But I hope I’m wrong.,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:53:00,Vasu, Do Khurram update overall grade?,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:53:00, Nicky, Yes I think I misunderstand between overall score and final score,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:53:00, Kirra, he said he will add for everyone,Tuesday
2020-04-21 19:53:00, Kirra, no but u can calculate your score,Tuesday
2020-04-21 21:22:00,Vasu, Do you get chance to call khurram?,Tuesday
2020-04-21 23:23:00, Nicky, No I dont have his number,Tuesday
